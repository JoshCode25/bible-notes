- Syn.: (A) [[Greek/hegeomai]] and (B) [[Greek/nomizo]] denote a belief resting not on one's inner feeling or sentiment, but on the due consideration of external grounds, and the weighing and comparing of facts. (C) [[Greek/dokeo]] and (D) [[Greek/oiomai]] on the other hand, describe a subjective judgment growing out of inclination or a view of facts in their relation to us. *Hegeomai* denotes a more deliberate and careful judgment than *nomizo*; *oiomai* is a subjective judgment which has feeling rather than thought (*dokeo*) for its ground.
