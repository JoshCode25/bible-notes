  collapsed:: true
	- 2 Timothy 1:1
	  Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God according to the promise of the life that is in Christ Jesus,
	- 2 Timothy 1:2
	  To Timothy, my beloved child:
	  Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
	- 2 Timothy 1:3
	  I thank God whom I serve, as did my ancestors, with a clear conscience, as I remember you constantly in my prayers night and day.
	- 2 Timothy 1:4
	  As I remember your tears, I long to see you, that I may be filled with joy.
	- 2 Timothy 1:5
	  I am reminded of your sincere faith, a faith that dwelt first in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice and now, I am sure, dwells in you as well.
	- 2 Timothy 1:6
	  For this reason I remind you to fan into flame the gift of God, which is in you through the laying on of my hands,
		- ((6696fb23-7407-4611-be1a-801c29d500e5))
	- 2 Timothy 1:7
	  for God gave us a spirit not of fear but of power and love and self-control.
	- 2 Timothy 1:8
	  Therefore do not be ashamed of the testimony about our Lord, nor of me his pris-oner, but share in suffering for the gospel by the power of God,
	- 2 Timothy 1:9
	  who saved us and I called us to a holy calling, not because of our works but because of his own purpose and grace, which he gave us in Christ Jesus before the ages began, #Predestination
	- 2 Timothy 1:10
	  and which now has been manifested through the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus, who abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel,
	- 2 Timothy 1:11
	  for which I was appointed a preacher and apostle and teacher,
	- 2 Timothy 1:12
	  which is why I suffer as I do. But I am not ashamed, for I know whom I have believed, and I am convinced that he is able to guard until that Day what has been entrusted to me.
	- 2 Timothy 1:13
	  Follow the pattern of the sound words that you have heard from me, in the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus.
	- 2 Timothy 1:14
	  By the Holy Spirit who dwells within us, guard the good deposit entrusted to you.
	- 2 Timothy 1:15
	  You are aware that all who are in Asia turned away from me, among whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes.
	- 2 Timothy 1:16
	  May the Lord grant mercy to the household of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chains,
	- 2 Timothy 1:17
	  but when he arrived in Rome he searched for me earnestly and found me—
	- 2 Timothy 1:18
	  may the Lord grant him to find mercy from the Lord on that Day!—and you well know all the service he rendered at Ephesus.
- 2 Timothy 2 #Annotate
	- 2 Timothy 2:1
	  You then, my child, be strengthened by the grace that is in Christ Jesus,
	- 2 Timothy 2:2
	  and what you have heard from me in the presence of many witnesses entrust to faithful men who will be able to teach others also.
	- 2 Timothy 2:3
	  Share in suffering as a good soldier of Christ Jesus.
	- 2 Timothy 2:4
	  No soldier gets entangled in civilian pursuits, since his aim is to please the one who enlisted him.
	- 2 Timothy 2:5
	  An athlete is not crowned unless he competes according to the rules.
	- 2 Timothy 2:6
	  It is the hard-working farmer who ought to have the first share of the crops.
	- 2 Timothy 2:7
	  Think over what I say, for the Lord will give you understanding in everything.
	- 2 Timothy 2:8
	  Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, the offspring of David, as preached in my gospel,
	- 2 Timothy 2:9
	  for which I am suffering, bound with chains as a criminal. But the word of God is not bound!
	- 2 Timothy 2:10
	  id:: 6697ac81-7fb8-4656-bfc8-a67f3a5d51b4
	  Therefore I endure everything for the sake of the [[Elect]], that they also may obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.
	- 2 Timothy 2:11
	  The saying is trustworthy, for:
	  If we have died with him, we will also live with him;
	- 2 Timothy 2:12
	  if we endure, we will also reign with him;
	  if we deny him, he also will deny us;
	- 2 Timothy 2:13
	  if we are faithless, he remains faithful
	- 2 Timothy 2:14
	  Remind them of these things, and charge them before [[God]] not to [[Quarrel]] about [[Word]]s, which does no [[Good]], but only ruins the [[Hear]]ers.
	- 2 Timothy 2:15
	  id:: 669666ea-22f8-4683-a500-647f80aa2719
	  Do [your]([[Timothy]]) best to [[Present]] yourself to [[God]] as one approved, a [[Work]]er who has no [[Need]] to be a[[Shame]]d, rightly handling the [[Word]] of [[Truth]] .
	- 2 Timothy 2:16
	  But avoid [[Irreverent]] babble, for it will lead [[People]] into more and more ungodliness,
	- 2 Timothy 2:17
	  and their talk will spread like gangrene. Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus,
	- 2 Timothy 2:18
	  who have swerved from the truth, saying that the resurrection has already happened. They are upsetting the faith of some.
	- 2 Timothy 2:19
	  But God's firm foundation stands, bearing this seal: "The Lord knows those who are his," and, "Let everyone who names the name of the Lord depart from iniquity."
	- 2 Timothy 2:20
	  Now in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver but also of wood and clay, some for honorable use, some for dishon-orable.
	- 2 Timothy 2:21
	  Therefore, if anyone cleanses himself from what is dishonorable, he will be a vessel for honorable use, set apart as holy, useful to the master of the house, ready for every good work.
	- 2 Timothy 2:22
	  So flee youthful passions and pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace, along with those who call on the Lord from a pure heart.
	- 2 Timothy 2:23
	  Have nothing to do with foolish, ignorant controversies; you know that they breed quarrels.
	- 2 Timothy 2:24
	  And the Lord's servant must not be quarrelsome but kind to everyone, able to teach, patiently enduring evil,
	- 2 Timothy 2:25
	  id:: 6697ad79-1699-4f5d-875b-5365941118bf
	  correcting his opponents with gentleness. God may perhaps grant them repentance leading to a knowledge of the truth,
	- 2 Timothy 2:26
	  and they may come to their senses and escape from the snare of the devil, after being captured by him to do his will.
- 2 Timothy 3
	- 2 Timothy 3:1
	  But [[Understand]] this, that in the [[Last]] [[Day]]s there will come [[Time]]s of difficulty. #Eschatology
	- 2 Timothy 3:2
	  For [[People]] will be [[Love]]rs of [[Self]], lovers of [[Money]], [proud]([[Pride]]), [[Arrogant]], [abusive]([[Abuse]]), [disobedient]([[Disobedience]]) to their [[Parent]]s, ungrateful, unholy,
	- 2 Timothy 3:3
	  [[Heart]]less, unappeasable, [[Slander]]ous, without [[Self Control]], brutal, not [loving]([[Love]]) [[Good]],
	- 2 Timothy 3:4
	  treacherous, reckless, swollen with conceit, [lovers]([[Love]]) of [[Pleasure]] rather than lovers of [[God]],
	- 2 Timothy 3:5
	  having the [[Appear]]ance of godliness, but [[Deny]]ing its [[Power]]. Avoid such people.
	- 2 Timothy 3:6
	  For among them are those who creep into households and [[Capture]] [[Weak]] [[women]], [[Burden]]ed with [[Sin]]s and led [[Astray]] by various [[Passion]]s,
	- 2 Timothy 3:7
	  always [[Learn]]ing and never able to arrive at a [[Knowledge]] of the [[Truth]].
	- 2 Timothy 3:8
	  Just as [[Jannes]] and [[Jambres]] [[Oppose]]d [[Moses]], so these [men]([[Man]]) also oppose the [[Truth]], men [[Corrupt]]ed in [[Mind]] and disqualified regarding the [[Faith]].
	- 2 Timothy 3:9
	  But they will not get very far, for their [folly]([[Fool]]) will be plain to all, as was that of those two [men]([[Man]]).
	- 2 Timothy 3:10
	  [You]([[Timothy]]), however, have followed [my]([[Paul]]) [[Teach]]ing, my conduct, my aim in [[Life]], my [[Faith]], my [[Patience]], my [[Love]], my [[Steadfast]]ness,
	- 2 Timothy 3:11
	  [my]([[Paul]]) [[Persecut]]ions and [[Suffer]]ings that happened to me at [[Antioch]], at [[Iconium]], and at [[Lystra]] -which persecutions I [[Endur]]ed; yet from them all the [[LORD]] [[Rescue]]d me.
	- 2 Timothy 3:12
	  Indeed, all who [[Desire]] to [[Live]] a godly [[Life]] in [[Christ]] [[Jesus]] will be [[Persecut]]ed,
	- 2 Timothy 3:13
	  while [[Evil]] [[People]] and [[Impostor]]s will go on from [[Bad]] to worse, deceiving and being [[Deceive]]d.
	- 2 Timothy 3:14
	  But as for [you]([[Timothy]]), continue in what you have [[Learn]]ed and have firmly [[Believe]]d, knowing from whom you learned it
	- 2 Timothy 3:15
	  and how from childhood [you]([[Timothy]]) have been acquainted with the [[Sacred]] [writings]([[Scripture]]), which are able to make you [[Wise]] for [[Salvation]] through [[Faith]] in [[Christ]] [[Jesus]].
	- 2 Timothy 3:16
	  All [[Scripture]] is [[Breath]]ed out by [[God]] and profitable for [[Teach]]ing, for reproof, for correction, and for [[Training]] in [[Righteous]]ness,
	- 2 Timothy 3:17
	  that the [[Man]] of [[God]] may be [[Complete]], [[Equip]]ped for every [[Good]] [[Work]].
- 2 Timothy 4 #Annotate
	- 2 Timothy 4:1
	  I charge [you]([[Timothy]]) in the [[Presence]] of [[God]] and of [[Christ]] [[Jesus]], who is to [[Judge]] the living and the [[Dead]], and by his [[Appear]]ing and his [[Kingdom]]:
		- ((6683e97c-d019-4526-92b1-cd378a6d3cac))
	- 2 Timothy 4:2
	  [[Preach]] the [[Word]]; be ready in [[Season]] and out of season; reprove, [[Rebuke]], and [[Exhort]], with [[Complete]] [[Patience]] and [[Teach]]ing.
	- 2 Timothy 4:3
	  For the [[Time]] is coming when [[People]] will not [[Endur]]e sound [[Teach]]ing, but having itching [[Ear]]s they will accumulate for themselves [[Teacher]]s to suit their own [[Passion]]s,
	- 2 Timothy 4:4
	  and will turn away from [[Listen]]ing to the [[Truth]] and [[Wander]] off into [[Myth]]s.
	- 2 Timothy 4:5
	  As for [you]([[Timothy]]), always be [[Sober]]- [[Mind]]ed, [[Endur]]e [[Suffer]]ing, do the [[Work]] of an [[Evangelist]], [[Fulfill]] your [[Ministry]].
	- 2 Timothy 4:6
	  For [I]([[Paul]]) am already being [[Pour]]ed out as a [[Drink]] [[Offer]]ing, and the [[Time]] of my departure has come.
	- 2 Timothy 4:7
	  [I]([[Paul]]) have fought the [[Good]] [[Fight]], I have [[Finish]]ed the [[Race]], I have kept the [[Faith]].
	- 2 Timothy 4:8
	  Henceforth there is laid up for [me]([[Paul]]) the [[Crown]] of [[Righteous]]ness, which the [[LORD]], the righteous [[Judge]], will award to me on that [[Day]], and not only to me but also to all who have [[Love]]d [His]([[Christ]]) [[Appear]]ing. #Eschatology
	- 2 Timothy 4:9
	  Do your best to come to me soon.
	- 2 Timothy 4:10
	  For Demas, in love with this present world, has deserted me and gone to Thessalonica. Crescens has gone to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia.
	- 2 Timothy 4:11
	  Luke alone is with me. Get Mark and bring him with you, for he is very useful to me for ministry.
	- 2 Timothy 4:12
	  Tychicus I have sent to Ephesus,
	- 2 Timothy 4:13
	  When you come, bring the cloak that I left with Carpus at Troas, also the books, and above all the parchments.
	- 2 Timothy 4:14
	  Alexander the coppersmith did me great harm; the Lord will repay him according to his deeds.
	- 2 Timothy 4:15
	  Beware of him yourself, for he strongly opposed our message.
	- 2 Timothy 4:16
	  At my first defense no one came to stand by me, but all deserted me. May it not be charged against them!
	- 2 Timothy 4:17
	  But the Lord stood by me and strengthened me, so that through me the message might be fully proclaimed and all the Gentiles might hear it. So I was rescued from the lion's mouth.
	- 2 Timothy 4:18
	  The Lord will rescue me from every evil deed and bring me safely into his heavenly kingdom. To him be the glory forever and ever. Amen.
	- 2 Timothy 4:19
	  Greet Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus.
	- 2 Timothy 4:20
	  Erastus remained at Corinth, and I left Trophimus, who was ill, at Miletus.
	- 2 Timothy 4:21
	  Do your best to come before winter. Eubulus sends greetings to you, as do Pudens and Linus and Claudia and all the brothers.
	- 2 Timothy 4:22
	  The Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with you.
