- Klino, "to incline, to bow down," is used
	- (1) of the women who in their fright "bowed" their faces to the earth at the Lord's empty tomb, Lk 24:5;
	- (2) of the act of the Lord on the cross immediately before giving up His Spirit. What is indicated in the statement "He bowed His head," is not the helpless dropping of the head after death, but the deliberate putting of His head into a position of rest, Jn 19:30. The verb is deeply significant here. The Lord reversed the natural order. The same verb is used in His statement in Mt 8:20 and Lk 9:58, "the Son of Man hath not where to lay His head."
	- (3) It is used, too, of the decline of day, Lk 9:12; 24:29;
	- (4) of turning enemies to flight, Heb 11:34.
