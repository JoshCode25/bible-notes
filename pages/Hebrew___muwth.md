		- (1c) Occasionally, muwth is used figuratively of land (Gen 47:19) or wisdom (Job 12:2).
		- (1d) Then, too, there is the unique hyperbolic expression that Nabal's heart had "died" within him, indicating that he was overcome with great fear (1 Sa 25:37).

	- (3) In the usual causative stem, this verb can mean "to cause to die" or "to kill"; God is the one who "puts to death" and gives life (Deut 32:39).
	- (4) Usually, both the subject and object of this usage are personal, although there are exceptions-as when the Philistines personified the ark of the covenant, urging its removal so it would not "kill" them (1 Sa 5:11).
	- (5) Death in this sense may also be inflicted by animals (Ex 21:29).

		- (7a) This idea is especially clear in the Creation account, in which God tells man that he will surely die if he eats of the forbidden fruit ( ((67091461-c0b2-4c0b-a79c-c0cffd5d8b5e)) -the [[First]] occurrence of the verb).
		- (7b) Apparently there was no death before this time. When the serpent questioned Eve, she associated disobedience with death ( ((670e5ad8-c246-4f97-ba92-d9e85be2fffa)) ). The serpent repeated God's words, but negated them ( ((670e57f7-e08d-44ab-83cf-5d5a0c3c8c34)) ).
