	  [[Paul]] and [[Timothy]], [[Servant]]s of [[Christ]] [[Jesus]],
	  To all the [[Saint]]s in Christ Jesus who are at [[Philippi]], with the overseers and  [[Deacon]]s:
	- Philippians 1:2
	  Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
	- Philippians 1:3
	  I thank my God in all my remembrance of you,
	- Philippians 1:4
	  always in every prayer of mine for you all making my prayer with joy,
	- Philippians 1:5
	  because of your partnership in the gospel from the first day until now.
	- Philippians 1:6
	  id:: 665f04e3-20c8-4579-984a-5b8e2eacc796
	  And [I]([[Paul]]) am sure of this, that [He]([[God]]) who [Began]([[Beginning]]) a [[Good]] [[Work]] in you will bring it to [Completion]([[Finish]]) at the day of [[Jesus]] [[Christ]].
	- Philippians 1:7
	  It is right for me to feel this way about you all, because I hold you in my heart, for you are all partakers with me of grace, both in my imprisonment and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel.
	- Philippians 1:8
	  For God is my witness, how I yearn for you all with the affection of Christ Jesus.
	- Philippians 1:9
	  id:: 66981cdc-ca01-4452-98c2-f87538772f0b
	  And it is my prayer that your love may [[Abound]] more and more, with knowledge and all discernment,
	- Philippians 1:10
	  id:: 66981cdc-1a5b-4696-bfa8-37b03447f871
	  so that you may [[Approve]] what is excellent, and so be [[Pure]] and [[Blameless]] for the [[Day]] of [[Christ]],
	- Philippians 1:11
	  filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.
	- Philippians 1:12
	  I want you to know, brothers, that what has happened to me has really served to advance the gospel,
	- Philippians 1:13
	  so that it has become known throughout the whole imperial guard and to all the rest that my imprisonment is for Christ.
	- Philippians 1:14
	  And most of the brothers, having become confident in the Lord by my imprisonment, are much more bold to speak the word without fear.
	- Philippians 1:15
	  Some indeed preach Christ from envy and rivalry, but others from good will.
	- Philippians 1:16
	  The latter do it out of love, knowing that I am put here for the defense of the gospel.

	  The former [[Proclaim]] [[Christ]] out of [[Selfish]] [[Ambition]], not [[Sincere]]ly but [[Think]]ing to [[Afflict]] [me]([[Paul]]) in my [imprisonment]([[Prison]]).
	- Philippians 1:18
	  What then? Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed, and in that I rejoice.
	  Yes, and I will rejoice,
	- Philippians 1:19
	  for I know that through your prayers and the help of the Spirit of Jesus Christ this will turn out for my deliverance,
	- Philippians 1:20
	  as it is my eager expectation and hope that I will not be at all ashamed, but that with full courage now as always Christ will be honored in my body, whether by life or by death.
	- Philippians 1:21
	  For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.
	- Philippians 1:22
	  If I am to live in the flesh, that means fruitful labor for me. Yet which I shall choose I cannot tell.
	- Philippians 1:23
	  I am hard pressed between the two. My desire is to depart and be with Christ, for that is far better.
	- Philippians 1:24
	  But to remain in the flesh is more necessary on your account.
	- Philippians 1:25
	  Convinced of this, I know that I will remain and continue with you all, for your progress and joy in the faith,
	- Philippians 1:26
	  so that in me you may have ample cause to glory in Christ Jesus, because of my coming to you again.
	- Philippians 1:27
	  Only let your manner of life be worthy of the gospel of Christ, so that whether I come and see you or am absent, I may hear of you that you are standing firm in one spirit, with one mind striving side by side for the faith of the gospel,
	- Philippians 1:28
	  and not frightened in anything by your opponents. This is a clear sign to them of their destruction, but of your salvation, and that from God.
	- Philippians 1:29
	  For it has been granted to you that for the sake of Christ you should not only believe in him but also suffer for his sake,
	- Philippians 1:30
	  engaged in the same conflict that you saw I had and now hear that I still have.

	  So if there is any encouragement in Christ, any comfort from love, any participation in the Spirit, any affection and sympathy,
	- Philippians 2:2
	  [[Complete]] [my]([[Paul]]) [[Joy]] by being of the same [[Mind]], having the same [[Love]], being in [[Full]] accord and of [[One]] mind.
	- Philippians 2:3
	  Do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit, but in humility count others more significant than yourselves.
	- Philippians 2:4
	  Let each of you look not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others.
	- Philippians 2:5
	  Have this [[Mind]] among yourselves, which is yours in [[Christ]] [[Jesus]],

	  who, though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped,

	  And being found in human form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross.
	- Philippians 2:9
	  Therefore God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name that is above every name,
	- Philippians 2:10
	  so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth,
	- Philippians 2:11
	  and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.
	- Philippians 2:12
	  Therefore, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, so now, not only as in my, presence but much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling,
	- Philippians 2:13
	  for it is God who works in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure.
	- Philippians 2:14
	  Do all things without grumbling or disputing,
	- Philippians 2:15
	  that you may be blameless and innocent, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and twisted generation, among whom you shine as lights in the world,
	- Philippians 2:16
	  holding fast to the word of life, so that in the day of Christ I may be proud that I did not run in vain or labor in vain. #Eschatology
	- Philippians 2:17
	  Even if I am to be poured out as a drink offering upon the sacrificial offering of your faith, I am glad and rejoice with you all.
	- Philippians 2:18
	  Likewise you also should be glad and rejoice with me.
- Philippians 4
	- Philippians 4:4
	  [[Rejoice]] in the [[LORD]] always; again [I]([[Paul]]) will say, rejoice.
	- Philippians 4:5
	  Let your reasonableness be [[Know]]n to everyone. The [[LORD]] is at [[Hand]];
	- Philippians 4:6
	  id:: 6750bd1d-17c9-4476-9acf-ed7398e7b42d
	  do not be [[Anxious]] about anything, but in everything by [[Prayer]] and [[Supplication]] with [[Thanksgiving]] let your [[Request]]s be made [[Know]]n to [[God]].
	- Philippians 4:7
	  And the [[Peace]] of [[God]], which [[Surpass]]es all [[Understand]]ing, will [[Guard]] your [[Heart]]s and your [[Mind]]s in [[Christ]] [[Jesus]].

	  Finally, [[Brother]]s, whatever is [[True]], whatever is [[Honor]]able, whatever is [just]([[Justice]]), whatever is [[Pure]], whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything  [[Worthy]] of [[Praise]], [[Think]] about these things.
