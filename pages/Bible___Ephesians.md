	  [[Grace]] to [you]([[Saint]]) and [[Peace]] from [[God]] our [[Father]] and the [[LORD]] [[Jesus]] [[Christ]].
	- Ephesians 1:3
	  [[Bless]]ed be the [[God]] and [[Father]] of our [[LORD]] [[Jesus]] [[Christ]], who has blessed us in Christ with every [[Spiritual]] blessing in the [[Heaven]]ly places.
	- Ephesians 1:4
	  even as [He]([[God]]) chose us in him before the [[Foundation]] of the [[World]], that we should be [[Holy]] and [[Blameless]] before him. In [[Love]]
	- Ephesians 1:5
	  id:: 6695124f-9ef0-45d5-a472-1c5c919df8ae
	  [He]([[God]]) [[Predestine]]d us for [[Adopt]]ion as [[Son]]s through [[Jesus]] [[Christ]], according to the [[Purpose]] of his [[Will]],
	- Ephesians 1:6
	  id:: 66a2536b-1cb4-43d5-9547-136dd2dbe5d2
	  to the [[Praise]] of [His]([[God]]) [glorious]([[Glory]]) [[Grace]] , with which he has [[Bless]]ed us in the [Beloved]([[Christ]]).
	- Ephesians 1:7

	- Ephesians 1:8
	  which [He]([[God]]) lavished upon us, in all [[Wisdom]] and insight

	  as a [[Plan]] for the fullness of [[Time]], to [unite]([[Unity]]) all things in [Him]([[God]]), things in [[Heaven]] and things on [[Earth]].
	- Ephesians 1:11
	  id:: 6695126b-e445-4845-99fd-deb826c07c74
	  In [Him]([[Christ]]) we have obtained an [[Inherit]]ance, having been [[Predestine]]d according to the [[Purpose]] of [Him]([[God]]) who [[Work]]s all things according to the [[Counsel]] of his [[Will]],
	- Ephesians 1:12
	  id:: 66a2536b-9f05-4181-ae55-eb2efbf19f98
	  so that we who were the [[First]] to [[Hope]] in [[Christ]] might be to the [[Praise]] of [His]([[God]]) [[Glory]].
	- Ephesians 1:13
	  In [Him]([[Christ]]) you also, when you [[Hear]]d the [[Word]] of [[Truth]], the [[Gospel]] of your [[Salvation]], and [[Believe]]d in [Him]([[Jesus]]), were [[Seal]]ed with the [[Promise]]d [[Holy Spirit]],
	- Ephesians 1:14
	  id:: 66a2536b-62ad-4616-8ef1-659dd524a3dd
	  [Who]([[Holy Spirit]]) is the [[Guarantee]] of our [[Inherit]]ance until we acquire possession of it, to the [[Praise]] of [His]([[God]]) [[Glory]].
	- Ephesians 1:15
	  For this reason, because [I]([[Paul]]) have [[Hear]]d of your [[Faith]] in the [[LORD]] [[Jesus]] and your [[Love]] toward all the [[Saint]]s,
	- Ephesians 1:16
	  [I]([[Paul]]) do not cease to give [[Thank]]s for you, [[Remember]]ing you in my [[Prayer]]s,
	- Ephesians 1:17
	  id:: 66a2536b-45c3-4d74-a85f-69743dbf11e3

	- Ephesians 1:18
	  having the [[Eye]]s of your [[Heart]]s [[Enlighten]]ed, that you may [[Know]] what is the [[Hope]] to which [He]([[God]]) has [[Call]]ed you, what are the [[Rich]]es of his [glorious]([[Glory]]) [[Inherit]]ance in the [[Saint]]s,
	- Ephesians 1:19
	  and what is the immeasurable greatness of [His]([[God]]) [[Power]] toward us who [[Believe]], according to the [[Work]]ing of his great [[Might]]
	- Ephesians 1:20

	  id:: 66a2536b-90e1-477b-ac22-7dbfd33e7e10

	  in which you once [[Walk]]ed, [[Follow]]ing the course of this [[World]], following the [[Prince]] of the [[Power]] of the [[Air]], the [[Spirit]] that is now at [[Work]] in the [[Son]]s of [[Disobedience]] —
	- Ephesians 2:3
	  among whom we all once [[Live]]d in the [[Passion]]s of our [[Flesh]], carrying out the [[Desire]]s of the [[Body]] and the [[Mind]], and were by [[Nature]] [[Children]] of [[Wrath]] like the rest of [[Mankind]].
	- Ephesians 2:4
	  But [[God]], being [[Rich]] in [[Mercy]], because of the great [[Love]] with God which he loved us,
	- Ephesians 2:5
	  even when we were [[Dead]] in our [[Trespass]]es, made us [alive]([[Life]]) together with [[Christ]] - by [[Grace]] you have been [[Saved]] -
	- Ephesians 2:6
	  and [[Raise]]d us up with him and seated us with him, in the [[Heaven]]ly places in [[Christ]] [[Jesus]],

	- Ephesians 2:10
	  id:: 667ea55f-1541-4b9b-9e6b-f27268e4e624
	  For we are His [workmanship]([[Poem]]), [[Create]]d in [[Christ]] [[Jesus]] for [[Good]] [[Work]]s, which [[God]] prepared beforehand, that we should [[Walk]] in them.
	- Ephesians 2:11
	  Therefore [[Remember]] that at one time you [[Gentile]]s in the [[Flesh]], called "the [uncircumcision]([[Uncircumcise]])" by what is called the [circumcision]([[Circumcise]]), which is made in the flesh by [[Hand]]s-
	- Ephesians 2:12
	  [[Remember]] that you were at that time [[Separate]]d from [[Christ]], alienated from the commonwealth of [[Israel]] and [[Stranger]]s to the [[Covenant]]s of [[Promise]], having no [[Hope]] and without [[God]] in the [[World]].
	- Ephesians 2:13
	  But now in [[Christ]] [[Jesus]] you who once were far off have been brought [[Near]] by the [[Blood]] of Christ.
	- Ephesians 2:14
	  For [He]([[Christ]]) himself is our [[Peace]], who has [[Made]] us both one and has [broken]([[Break]]) down in his [[Flesh]] the [dividing]([[Divide]]) [[Wall]] of [hostility]([[Hostile]])
	- Ephesians 2:15
	  by abolishing the [[Law]] of [[Command]]ments expressed in ordinances, that [He]([[Christ]]) might [[Create]] in himself one [[New]] [[Man]] in place of the two, so making [[Peace]],
	- Ephesians 2:16
	  and might [[Reconcil]]e us both to [[God]] in one [[Body]] through the [[Cross]], thereby [[Kill]]ing the [hostility]([[Hostile]]).
	- Ephesians 2:17
	  And [He]([[Christ]]) [came]([[Come]]) and [[Preach]]ed [[Peace]] to you who were far off and peace to those who were [[Near]].
	- Ephesians 2:18
	  For through [Him]([[Christ]]) we both have access in one [Spirit]([[Holy Spirit]]) to the [[Father]].
	- Ephesians 2:19
	  So then you are no longer [[Stranger]]s and [[Alien]]s, but you are fellow [[Citizen]]s with the [[Saint]]s and members of the [[House]]hold of [[God]],
	- Ephesians 2:20
	  [built]([[Build]]) on the [[Foundation]] of the [[Apostle]]s and [[Prophet]]s, [[Christ]] [[Jesus]] himself being the [[Cornerstone]],
	- Ephesians 2:21

	  in whom the whole [[Structure]], being joined together, [[Grow]]s into a [[Holy]] [[Temple]] in the [[LORD]].

	  For this [[Reason]] I, [[Paul]], a [[Prisoner]] for [[Christ]] [[Jesus]] on behalf of you [[Gentile]]s—
	- Ephesians 3:2
	  assuming that you have [[Hear]]d of the [[Steward]]ship of [[God]]'s [[Grace]] that was [given]([[Gift]]) to [me]([[Paul]]) for [you]([[Gentile]]),
	- Ephesians 3:3
	  id:: 66a2536b-ded6-47bd-bf89-025d0a7bbc87
	  how the [[Mystery]] was made [[Know]]n to [me]([[Paul]]) by [revelation]([[Reveal]]), as I have [[Written]] briefly.
	- Ephesians 3:4
	  When you [[Read]] this, [you]([[Gentile]]) can perceive [my]([[Paul]]) insight into the [[Mystery]] of [[Christ]],
	- Ephesians 3:5
	  id:: 66a2536b-1a9b-4584-ad6b-625c0fe20eb5
	  which was not made [[Know]]n to the [[Son]]s of [men]([[Man]]) in other [[Generation]]s as it has now been [[Reveal]]ed to [His]([[Christ]]) [[Holy]] [[Apostle]]s and [[Prophet]]s by the [Spirit]([[Holy Spirit]]).
	- Ephesians 3:6
	  This [[Mystery]] is that the [[Gentile]]s are fellow [[Heir]]s, [[Member]]s of the same [[Body]], and partakers of the [[Promise]] in [[Christ]] [[Jesus]] through the [[Gospel]].
	- Ephesians 3:7
	  Of this [[Gospel]] [I]([[Paul]]) was made a [[Minister]] according to the [[Gift]] of [[God]]'s [[Grace]], which was given me by the [[Work]]ing of his [[Power]].
	- Ephesians 3:8
	  To [me]([[Paul]]), though I am the very least of all the [[Saint]]s, this [[Grace]] was [given]([[Gift]]), to [[Preach]] to the [[Gentile]]s the un[[search]]able [[Rich]]es of [[Christ]],
	- Ephesians 3:9
	  and to bring to [[Light]] for everyone what is the plan of the [[Mystery]] [hidden]([[Hide]]) for [[Age]]s in [[God]] who [[Create]]d all things,
	- Ephesians 3:10
	  id:: 669f9f0c-82a4-46f2-bf91-4dbd91f2cf6b
	  so that through the [[Church]] the manifold [[Wisdom]] of [[God]] might now be made [[Know]]n to the [[Ruler]]s and [authorities]([[Authority]]) in the [[Heaven]]ly places.
	- Ephesians 3:11
	  This was according to the [[Etern]]al [[Purpose]] that [He]([[God]]) has [[Realize]]d in [[Christ]] [[Jesus]] our [[Lord]],
	- Ephesians 3:12
	  in [whom]([[Christ]]) we have [[Bold]]ness and access with [[Confidence]] through our [[Faith]] in him.
	- Ephesians 3:13
	  So [I]([[Paul]]) [[Ask]] [you]([[Gentile]]) not to lose [[Heart]] over what I am [[Suffer]]ing for you, which is your [[Glory]].
	- Ephesians 3:14
	  For this reason [I]([[Paul]]) [[Bow]] my [[Knee]]s before the [[Father]],
	- Ephesians 3:15
	  from [whom]([[God]]) every [[Family]] in [[Heaven]] and on [[Earth]] is [[Name]]d,
	- Ephesians 3:16
	  that according to the [[Rich]]es of [His]([[God]]) [[Glory]] he may grant you to be [[Strength]]ened with [[Power]] through his [Spirit]([[Holy Spirit]]) in your inner being,
	- Ephesians 3:17
	  so that [[Christ]] may [[Dwell]] an in your [[Heart]]s through [[Faith]] - that you, being [[Root]]ed and [[Ground]]ed in [[Love]],
	- Ephesians 3:18
	  may have [[Strength]] to [[Comprehend]] with all the [[Saint]]s what is the breadth and [[Length]] and [[Height]] and [[Depth]],
	- Ephesians 3:19
	  and to [[Know]] the [[Love]] of [[Christ]] that surpasses [[Knowledge]], that you may be [[Fill]]ed with all the fullness of [[God]].
	- Ephesians 3:20
	  id:: 66a2536b-f2c4-46ac-a92a-f1d80e475516
	  Now to [Him]([[God]]) who is able to do far more [[Abundant]]ly than all that we [[Ask]] or [[Think]], according to the [[Power]] at [[Work]] within us,
	- Ephesians 3:21
	  to [Him]([[God]]) be [[Glory]] in the [[Church]] and in [[Christ]] [[Jesus]] throughout all [[Generation]]s, [[Forever]] and ever. [[Amen]].

	  with all [[Humility]] and [[Gentle]]ness, with [[Patience]], [[Bear]]ing with one another in [[Love]],
	- Ephesians 4:3
	  eager to maintain the [[Unity]] of the [Spirit]([[Holy Spirit]]) in the [[Bond]] of [[Peace]].

	  [[One]] [[LORD]], one [[Faith]], one [baptism]([[Baptize]]),
	- Ephesians 4:6
	  [[One]] [[God]] and [[Father]] of all, who is over all and through all and in all.
	- Ephesians 4:7
	  But [[Grace]] was given to each one of us according to the measure of [[Christ]]’s [[Gift]].
	- Ephesians 4:8
	  Therefore it says,

	  (In saying, "[He]([[Christ]]) ascended," what does it mean but that he had also descended into the lower regions, the [[Earth]]?
	- Ephesians 4:10
	  [He]([[Christ]]) who descended is the one who also ascended far above all the [[Heaven]]s, that he might [[Fill]] all things.)
	- Ephesians 4:11
	  And [He]([[God]]) gave the [[Apostle]]s, the [[Prophet]]s, the [[Evangelist]]s, the [[Shepherd]]s and [[Teacher]]s,
	- Ephesians 4:12
	  to [[Equip]] the [[Saint]]s for the [[Work]] of [[Ministry]], for [[Build]]ing up the [[Body]] of [[Christ]],

	  until we all attain to the [[Unity]] of the [[Faith]] and of the [[Knowledge]] of the [[Son]] of [[God]], to [[Mature]] [[Man]]hood, to the measure of the stature of the [fullness]([[Fill]]) of [[Christ]],
	- Ephesians 4:14
	  id:: 667d6bbf-71ac-444a-b1a9-361e95317ff9
	  so that we may no longer be [[Children]], tossed to and fro by the [[Wave]]s and carried about by every [[Wind]] of [[Doctrine]], by [[Human]] cunning, by craftiness in [Deceitful]([[Deceive]]) [[Scheme]]s.

	  Rather, [[Speak]]ing the [[Truth]] in [[Love]], we are to [[Grow]] up in every way into him who is the [[Head]], into [[Christ]],
	- Ephesians 4:16

	  from [whom]([[Christ]]) the whole [[Body]], joined and held together by every joint with which it is [[Equip]]ped, when each part is [[Work]]ing properly, makes the body [[Grow]] so that it [[Build]]s itself up in [[Love]].
	- Ephesians 4:17
	  Now this [I]([[Paul]]) say and testify in the [[LORD]], that you must no longer [[Walk]] as the [[Gentile]]s do, in the futility of their [[Mind]]s.
	- Ephesians 4:18
	  [They]([[Gentile]]) are [[Dark]]ened in their [[Understand]]ing, alienated from the [[Life]] of [[God]] because of the [ignorance]([[Ignorant]]) that is in them, due to their [[Hard]]ness of [[Heart]].
	- Ephesians 4:19
	  [They]([[Gentile]]) have become callous and have given themselves up to sensuality, [[Greed]]y to [[Practice]] every kind of impurity.
	- Ephesians 4:20
	  But that is not the way you [[Learn]]ed [[Christ]]!—
	- Ephesians 4:21

	- Ephesians 4:27
	  and [give]([[Gift]]) no opportunity to the [[Devil]].
	- Ephesians 4:28
	  Let the [[Thief]] no longer [[Steal]], but rather let him labor, doing honest [[Work]] with his own [[Hand]]s, so that he may have something to share with anyone in [[Need]].
	- Ephesians 4:29
	  Let no [[Corrupt]]ing [[Talk]] come out of your [[Mouth]]s, but only such as is [[Good]] for [[Build]]ing up, as fits the occasion, that it may [give]([[Gift]]) [[Grace]] to those who [[Hear]].
	- Ephesians 4:30
	  And do not [[Grieve]] the [[Holy Spirit]] of [[God]], by whom you were [[Seal]]ed for the [[Day]] of [redemption]([[Redeem]]).
	- Ephesians 4:31
	  Let all [[Bitterness]] and [[Wrath]] and [[Anger]] and clamor and [[Slander]] be put away from you, along with all [[Malice]].
	- Ephesians 4:32
	  Be [[Kind]] to one another, tender[[Heart]]ed, [forgiving]([[Forgive]]) one another, as [[God]] in [[Christ]] forgave you:
- Ephesians 5
  id:: 667aaaab-1a1a-4e9b-90a4-1e33602e37e9
	- Ephesians 5:1
	  Therefore be imitators of [[God]], as [[Beloved]] [[Children]].
	- Ephesians 5:2
	  and [[Walk]] in [[Love]], as [[Christ]] loved us and [gave]([[Gift]]) himself up for us, a fragrant [[Offer]]ing and [[Sacrifice]] to [[God]].
	- Ephesians 5:3
	  But [[Sexual]] [[Immoral]]ity and all impurity or [[Covet]]ousness must not even be [[Name]]d among you, as is proper among [[Saint]]s.
	- Ephesians 5:4
	  Let there be no filthiness nor [[Fool]]ish [[Talk]] nor [[Crude]] [joking]([[Joke]]), which are out of place, but instead let there be [[Thanksgiving]].
	- Ephesians 5:5
	  For you may be sure of this, that everyone who is [[Sexual]]ly [[Immoral]] or impure, or who is [[Covet]]ous (that is, an [[Idolat]]er), has no [inheritance]([[Inherit]]) in the [[Kingdom]] of [[Christ]] and [[God]].

	  id:: 667aab43-656d-47f7-835c-4462215e9529
	  Let no one [[Deceive]] you with [[Empty]] [[Word]]s, for because of these things the [[Wrath]] of [[God]] comes upon the [[Son]]s of [[Disobedience]].
	- Ephesians 5:7
	  Therefore do not become [[Partner]]s with [them](((667aab43-656d-47f7-835c-4462215e9529)));
	- Ephesians 5:8
	  for at one time you were [[Dark]]nes, but now you are [[Light]] in the [[LORD]]. [[Walk]] as [[Children]] of light
	- Ephesians 5:9
	  (for the [[Fruit]] of [[Light]] is found in all that is [[Good]] and right and [[True]]),
	- Ephesians 5:10
	  id:: 667aaab1-6c48-4c0c-8c40-202696bebd49

	- Ephesians 5:11
	  Take no part in the [unfruitful]([[Fruit]]) [[Work]]s of [[Dark]]ness, but instead [[Expose]] them.
	- Ephesians 5:12
	  For it is [[Shame]]ful even to [[Speak]] of the things that [they]([[Gentile]]) do in [[Secret]].
	- Ephesians 5:13
	  But when anything is [[Expose]]d by the [[Light]], it becomes visible,
	- Ephesians 5:14
	  for anything that becomes visible is [[Light]]. Therefore it says,
	  "Awake, O [[Sleep]]er,
	  and [[Arise]] from the [[Dead]], 
	  and [[Christ]] will [[Shine]] on you."

	  And do not get [[Drunk]] with [[Wine]], for that is debauchery, but be [[Fill]]ed with the [Spirit]([[Holy Spirit]]),

	  id:: 66a6f052-00b8-4ced-b35a-45eb1aa68fa2

	  [[Husband]]s, [[Love]] your [wives]([[Wife]]), as [[Christ]] loved the [[Church]] and [gave]([[Gift]]) himself up for her,

	  that [He]([[Christ]]) might [[Sanctif]]y [her]([[Church]]), having [[Clean]]sed her by the [[Wash]]ing of [[Water]] with [the Word]([[Bible]]),

	  so that [He]([[Christ]]) might [[Present]] the [[Church]] to himself in splendor, without spot or wrinkle or any such thing, that she might be [[Holy]] and without blemish.
	- Ephesians 5:28
	  In the same way [[Husband]]s should [[Love]] their [wives]([[Wife]]) as their own [bodies]([[Body]]). He who loves his wife loves himself.
	- Ephesians 5:29
	  id:: 66a6f052-9da3-41ec-a233-cbaaabb5bb27
	  For no one ever [[Hate]]d his own [[Flesh]], but [[Nourish]]es and [[Cherish]]es it, just as [[Christ]] does the [[Church]],
	- Ephesians 5:30
	  because we are [[Member]]s of [His]([[Christ]]) [[Body]].
	- Ephesians 5:31
	  "Therefore a [[Man]] shall leave his [[Father]] and [[Mother]] and hold fast to his [[Wife]], and the [[Two]] shall become [[One]] [[Flesh]]."
		- ((66a6b5a0-6b88-48ee-931f-21a5ea66b5e6))
	- Ephesians 5:32
	  This [[Mystery]] is profound, and [I]([[Paul]]) am saying that it refers to [[Christ]] and the [[Church]].
	- Ephesians 5:33
	  However, let each one of you [[Love]] his [[Wife]] as himself, and let the wife see that she [[Respect]]s her [[Husband]].
- Ephesians 6

	- Ephesians 6:2
	  "[[Honor]] your [[Father]] and [[Mother]]" (this is the [[First]] [[Command]]ment with a [[Promise]]),

	- Ephesians 6:3
	  "that it may go well with you and that you may [[Live]] long in the [land]([[Promised Land]])."

	- Ephesians 6:4
	  [[Father]]s, do not [[Provoke]] your [[Children]] to [[Anger]], but bring them up in the [[Discipline]] and [[Instruct]]ion of the [[LORD]].
	- Ephesians 6:5
	  [Bondservants]([[Servant]]), [[Obey]] your [[Earth]]ly [[Master]]s with [[Fear]] and [[Trembl]]ing, with a [[Sincere]] [[Heart]], as I you would [[Christ]],
	- Ephesians 6:6
	  not by the way of [[Eye]]-[service]([[Serve]]), as [[People]]-[[Please]]rs, but as [bondservants]([[Servant]]) of [[Christ]], doing the [[Will]] of [[God]] from the [[Heart]],
	- Ephesians 6:7
	  rendering [service]([[Serve]]) with a [[Good]] [[Will]] as to the [[LORD]] and not to [man]([[Mankind]]),
	- Ephesians 6:8
	  [[Know]]ing that whatever [[Good]] anyone does, this he will [[Receive]] back from the [[LORD]], whether he is a [bondservant]([[Servant]]) or is [[Free]].
	- Ephesians 6:9
	  id:: 66a6f052-4e35-4664-82a7-d6299b1f3f06
	  [[Master]]s, do the same to them, and stop your [[Threat]]ening, [[Know]]ing that [He]([[God]]) who is both their Master and yours is in [[Heaven]], and there is no [[Partial]]ity with him.
	- Ephesians 6:10
	  Finally, be [[Strong]] in the [[LORD]] and in the [[Strength]] of [His]([[God]]) [[Might]].
	- Ephesians 6:11
	  id:: 66aa6f74-f71b-4db1-b03e-e4ef15e12ce7
	  Put on the whole [[Armor]] of [[God]], that you may be able to [[Stand]] against the [[Scheme]]s of the [[Devil]].
	- Ephesians 6:12
	  For we do not [[Wrestle]] [[Against]] [[Flesh]] and [[Blood]], but against the [[Ruler]]s, against the [authorities]([[Authority]]), against the [[Cosmic]] [[Power]]s over this [[Present]] [[Dark]]ness, against the [[Spiritual]] [[Force]]s of [[Evil]] in the [[Heaven]]ly places.
	- Ephesians 6:13
	  Therefore take up the whole [[Armor]] of [[God]], that you may be able to withstand in the [[Evil]] [[Day]], and having done all, to [[Stand]] firm.

	  [[Stand]] therefore, having fastened on the [[Belt]] of [[Truth]], and having put on the [[Breastplate]] of [[Righteous]]ness,
	- Ephesians 6:15
	  and, as [[Shoe]]s for your [feet]([[Foot]]), having put on the readiness [given]([[Gift]]) by the [[Gospel]] of [[Peace]].

	  In all circumstances take up the [[Shield]] of [[Faith]], with which you can extinguish all the [flaming]([[Fire]]) darts of the [[Evil]] [[One]];
	- Ephesians 6:17
	  and take the [[Helmet]] of [[Salvation]], and the [[Sword]] of the [Spirit]([[Holy Spirit]]), which is the [[Word]] of [[God]]
	- Ephesians 6:18
	  [[Pray]]ing at all [[Time]]s in the [Spirit]([[Holy Spirit]]), with all [[Prayer]] and [[Supplication]]. To that end keep alert with all [perseverance]([[Persevere]]), making supplication for all the [[Saint]]s,
	- Ephesians 6:19
	  and also for [me]([[Paul]]), that [[Word]]s may be [given]([[Gift]]) to me in [[Open]]ing my [[Mouth]] [[Bold]]ly to proclaim the [[Mystery]] of the [[Gospel]],
	- Ephesians 6:20
	  for which [I]([[Paul]]) am an [[Ambassador]] in [[Chain]]s, that I may declare [it]([[Gospel]]) [[Bold]]ly, as I ought to [[Speak]].
	- Ephesians 6:21
	  So that you also may [[Know]] how [I]([[Paul]]) am and what I am doing, [[Tychicus]] the [[Beloved]] [[Brother]] and [[Faithful]] [[Minister]] in the [[LORD]] will tell you everything.
	- Ephesians 6:22
	  [I]([[Paul]]) have sent [him]([[Tychicus]]) to you for this very [[Purpose]], that you may [[Know]] how we are, and that he may [[Encourage]] your [[Heart]]s.

	  [[Peace]] be to the [[Brother]]s, and [[Love]] with [[Faith]], from [[God]] the [[Father]] and the [[LORD]] [[Jesus]] [[Christ]].
