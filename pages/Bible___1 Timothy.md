	  [[Grace]], [[Mercy]], and [[Peace]] from [[God]] the [[Father]] and [[Christ]] [[Jesus]] our [[LORD]].

	  [[First]] of all, then, [I]([[Paul]]) urge that [[Supplication]]s, [[Prayer]]s, [[Intercession]]s, and [[Thanksgiving]]s be [[Made]] for all [[People]],
	- 1 Timothy 2:2
	  for [[King]]s and all who are in high positions, that we may [[Lead]] a [[Peace]]ful and [[Quiet]] [[Life]], [[Godly]] and [dignified]([[Dignity]]) in every [[Way]].
	- 1 Timothy 2:3
	  This is [[Good]], and it is [pleasing]([[Please]]) in the [sight]([[See]]) of [[God]] our [[Savior]],
	- 1 Timothy 2:4
	  [who]([[God]]) [[Desire]]s all [[People]] to be [[Saved]] and to [[Come]] to the [[Knowledge]] of the [[Truth]].
	- 1 Timothy 2:5
	  For there is [[One]] [[God]], and there is one [[Mediator]] between God and [men]([[Mankind]]), the [[Man]] [[Christ]] [[Jesus]],
	- 1 Timothy 2:6
	  who [gave]([[Gift]]) [Himself]([[Christ]]) as a [[Ransom]] for all, which is the [[Testimony]] given at the proper [[Time]].
	- 1 Timothy 2:7
	  For this [I]([[Paul]]) was [[Appoint]]ed a [[Preacher]] and an [[Apostle]] (I am telling the [[Truth]], I am not [lying]([[Lie]])), a [[Teacher]] of the [[Gentile]]s in [[Faith]] and truth.

	  id:: 67519fc7-c9a5-420c-96b4-41e196f43c6c
	  [I]([[Paul]]) [[Desire]] then that in every [[Place]] the [men]([[Man]]) should [[Pray]], lifting [[Holy]] [[Hand]]s without [[Anger]] or [[Quarrel]]ing;
	- 1 Timothy 2:12
	  id:: 6710f66d-5b8d-4c93-a9d3-a6e9d87214ef
	  [I]([[Paul]]) do not [[Permit]] a [[Woman]] to [[Teach]] or to exercise [[Authority]] over a [[Man]]; rather, she is to remain [[Quiet]].
	- 1 Timothy 2:13
	  For [[Adam]] was [[Form]]ed [[First]], then [[Eve]];
		- ((67067136-1359-4f3a-aae2-9b2ab227e66a))
	- 1 Timothy 2:14
	  and [[Adam]] was not [[Deceive]]d, but the [woman]([[Eve]]) was deceived and became a [[Transgress]]or.

	  Now the [Spirit]([[Holy Spirit]]) expressly says that in later [[Time]]s some will depart from the [[Faith]] by [devoting]([[Devote]]) themselves to [deceitful]([[Deceive]]) [[Spirit]]s and [[Teach]]ings of [[Demon]]s, #Eschatology
	- 1 Timothy 4:2
	  through the insincerity of [[Liar]]s whose [[Conscience]]s are seared,
	- 1 Timothy 4:3
	  who forbid [[Marriage]] and require abstinence from [[Food]]s that [[God]] [[Create]]d to be [[Receive]]d with [[Thanksgiving]] by those who [[Believe]] and [[Know]] the [[Truth]].
	- 1 Timothy 4:4
	  For everything [[Create]]d by [[God]] is [[Good]], and nothing is to be [[Reject]]ed if it is [[Receive]]d with [[Thanksgiving]],
	- 1 Timothy 4:5
	  for it is made [[Holy]] by the [[Word]] of [[God]] and [[Prayer]] .
	- 1 Timothy 4:6
	  If [you]([[Timothy]]) put these things before the [[Brother]]s, you will be a [[Good]] [[Servant]] of [[Christ]] [[Jesus]] , being [trained]([[Training]]) in the [[Word]]s of the [[Faith]] and of the good [[Doctrine]] that you have [[Follow]]ed.
	- 1 Timothy 4:7
	  Have nothing to do with [[Irreverent]], silly [[Myth]]s. Rather [train]([[Training]]) [yourself]([[Timothy]]) for godliness;
	- 1 Timothy 4:8
	  for while [bodily]([[Body]]) [[Training]] is of some [[Value]], godliness is of value in every way, as it holds [[Promise]] for the [[Present]] [[Life]] and also for the life to come.
	- 1 Timothy 4:9
	  The saying is [[Trust]]worthy and deserving of full acceptance.
	- 1 Timothy 4:10
	  For to this end we [[Toil]] and [[Strive]], because we have our [[Hope]] set on the [living]([[Life]]) [[God]], who is the [[Savior]] of all [[People]], especially of those who [[Believe]].
	- 1 Timothy 4:11
	  [[Command]] and [[Teach]] these things.
	- 1 Timothy 4:12
	  Let no one [[Despise]] [you]([[Timothy]]) for your [[Youth]], but set the [[Believer]]s an [[Example]] in [[Speech]], in conduct, in [[Love]], in [[Faith]], in [purity]([[Pure]]).
	- 1 Timothy 4:13
	  Until [I]([[Paul]]) come, [[Devote]] [yourself]([[Timothy]]) to the public [[Read]]ing of [[Scripture]], to [[Exhort]]ation, to [[Teach]]ing.
	- 1 Timothy 4:14
	  id:: 6696fb23-7407-4611-be1a-801c29d500e5
	  Do not neglect the [gift]([[Spiritual Gift]]) [you]([[Timothy]]) have, which was given you by [[Prophecy]] when the [[Council]] of [[Elder]]s laid their [[Hand]]s on you.
	- 1 Timothy 4:15
	  [[Practice]] these things, immerse [yourself]([[Timothy]]) in them, so that all may [[See]] your [[Progress]] .
	- 1 Timothy 4:16
	  Keep a close [[Watch]] on [yourself]([[Timothy]]) and on the [[Teach]]ing. Persist in this, for by so doing you will [[Save]] both yourself and your [[Hear]]ers.
- 1 Timothy 5
	- 1 Timothy 5:1
	  Do not [[Rebuke]] an [[Old]]er [[Man]] but [[Encourage]] him as you would a [[Father]], [[Young]]er men as [[Brother]]s,
	- 1 Timothy 5:2
	  [[Old]]er [women]([[Woman]]) as [[Mother]]s, [[Young]]er women as [[Sister]]s, in all [purity]([[Pure]]).
	- 1 Timothy 5:3
	  [[Honor]] [[Widow]]s who are [truly]([[True]]) widows.
	- 1 Timothy 5:4
	  But if a [[Widow]] has [[Children]] or [[Grandchild]]ren, let them first learn to [[Show]] [godliness]([[Godly]]) to their own [[Household]] and to [[Make]] some [[Return]] to their [[Parent]]s, for this is [pleasing]([[Please]]) in the [sight]([[See]]) of [[God]].
	- 1 Timothy 5:5
	  id:: 6752f200-1ef8-4c6b-ab57-955eecf0f349
	  She who is [truly]([[True]]) a [[Widow]], left all [[Alone]], has set her [[Hope]] on [[God]] and continues in [[Supplication]]s and [[Prayer]]s [[Night]] and [[Day]],
	- 1 Timothy 5:6
	  but she who is self-indulgent is [[Dead]] even while she [[Live]]s.
	- 1 Timothy 5:7
	  [[Command]] these things as well, so that they may be without [[Reproach]].
	- 1 Timothy 5:8
	  But if anyone does not [[Provide]] for his [[Relative]]s, and especially for [[Member]]s of his [[Household]], he has [denied]([[Deny]]) the [[Faith]] and is [[Worse]] than an [[Unbeliever]].
- 1 Timothy 6
	- 1 Timothy 6:14
	  to [[Keep]] the [[Command]]ment unstained and [[Free]] from [[Reproach]] until the [[Appear]]ing of our [[LORD]] [[Jesus]] [[Christ]],
		- ((6684088b-6d15-45ec-b99a-4b264f3c31cd))
	- 1 Timothy 6:15
	  which [He]([[Christ]]) will [[Display]] at the proper [[Time]] - [He]([[Jesus]]) who is the [[Bless]]ed and only [[Sovereign]], the [[King]] of kings and [[LORD]] of lords,
