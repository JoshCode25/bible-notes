	  [I]([[Paul]]) do not [[Permit]] a [[Woman]] to [[Teach]] or to exercise [[Authority]] over a [[Man]]; rather, she is to remain [[Quiet]].
	- 1 Timothy 2:13
	  For [[Adam]] was [[Form]]ed [[First]], then [[Eve]];

	- 1 Timothy 2:14
	  and [[Adam]] was not [[Deceive]]d, but the [woman]([[Eve]]) was deceived and became a [[Transgress]]or.

	  Now the [Spirit]([[Holy Spirit]]) expressly says that in later [[Time]]s some will depart from the [[Faith]] by [devoting]([[Devote]]) themselves to [deceitful]([[Deceive]]) [[Spirit]]s and [[Teach]]ings of [[Demon]]s, #Eschatology
	- 1 Timothy 4:2
	  through the insincerity of [[Liar]]s whose [[Conscience]]s are seared,
	- 1 Timothy 4:3
	  who forbid [[Marriage]] and require abstinence from [[Food]]s that [[God]] [[Create]]d to be [[Receive]]d with [[Thanksgiving]] by those who [[Believe]] and [[Know]] the [[Truth]].
	- 1 Timothy 4:4
	  For everything [[Create]]d by [[God]] is [[Good]], and nothing is to be [[Reject]]ed if it is [[Receive]]d with [[Thanksgiving]],
	- 1 Timothy 4:5
	  for it is made [[Holy]] by the [[Word]] of [[God]] and [[Prayer]] .
	- 1 Timothy 4:6
	  If [you]([[Timothy]]) put these things before the [[Brother]]s, you will be a [[Good]] [[Servant]] of [[Christ]] [[Jesus]] , being [trained]([[Training]]) in the [[Word]]s of the [[Faith]] and of the good [[Doctrine]] that you have [[Follow]]ed.
	- 1 Timothy 4:7
	  Have nothing to do with [[Irreverent]], silly [[Myth]]s. Rather [train]([[Training]]) [yourself]([[Timothy]]) for godliness;
	- 1 Timothy 4:8
	  for while [bodily]([[Body]]) [[Training]] is of some [[Value]], godliness is of value in every way, as it holds [[Promise]] for the [[Present]] [[Life]] and also for the life to come.
	- 1 Timothy 4:9
	  The saying is [[Trust]]worthy and deserving of full acceptance.
	- 1 Timothy 4:10
	  For to this end we [[Toil]] and [[Strive]], because we have our [[Hope]] set on the [living]([[Life]]) [[God]], who is the [[Savior]] of all [[People]], especially of those who [[Believe]].
	- 1 Timothy 4:11
	  [[Command]] and [[Teach]] these things.
	- 1 Timothy 4:12
	  Let no one [[Despise]] [you]([[Timothy]]) for your [[Youth]], but set the [[Believer]]s an [[Example]] in [[Speech]], in conduct, in [[Love]], in [[Faith]], in [purity]([[Pure]]).
	- 1 Timothy 4:13
	  Until [I]([[Paul]]) come, [[Devote]] [yourself]([[Timothy]]) to the public [[Read]]ing of [[Scripture]], to [[Exhort]]ation, to [[Teach]]ing.
	- 1 Timothy 4:14
	  id:: 6696fb23-7407-4611-be1a-801c29d500e5
	  Do not neglect the [gift]([[Spiritual Gift]]) [you]([[Timothy]]) have, which was given you by [[Prophecy]] when the [[Council]] of [[Elder]]s laid their [[Hand]]s on you.
	- 1 Timothy 4:15
	  [[Practice]] these things, immerse [yourself]([[Timothy]]) in them, so that all may [[See]] your [[Progress]] .
	- 1 Timothy 4:16
	  Keep a close [[Watch]] on [yourself]([[Timothy]]) and on the [[Teach]]ing. Persist in this, for by so doing you will [[Save]] both yourself and your [[Hear]]ers.
