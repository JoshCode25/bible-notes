- **Yacaph** means "to add, continue, do again, increase, surpass."
	- (1) Basically, yacaph signifies increasing the number of something.
	- (2) It may also be used to indicate adding one thing to another, e.g., ((67617673-dc07-4565-a057-cfd7b0bf50ee))
	- (3) This verb may be used to signify the repetition of an act stipulated by another verb. For example, the dove that Noah sent out "did not return to him anymore.” ((67617722-cfcf-453d-9638-12b8fe990220))
	- (4) Usually the repeated action is indicated by an infinitive absolute, preceded by the preposition ie -"And he did not know her again." Literally, this reads "And he did not add again \[[[Hebrew/od]]] to knowing her [intimately]" ((676177d2-280c-4a97-9a3a-59e6b5a736de))
	- (5) In some contexts yacaph means "to heighten," but with no suggestion of numerical increase.
		- (5a) God says, "The meek also shall obtain freah (yacaph) joy in the Lord ...." ((6762c300-3e30-4056-941a-a8953a48a112))

		- (5c) In such cases, more than an additional quantity of joy or praise is meant. The author is referring to a new quality of joy or praise-i.e., a heightening of them.
	- (6) Another meaning of yacaph is "to surpass." The Queen of Sheba told Solomon, "Your wisdom and prosperity surpass the report that I heard," or literally, "You add [with respect to] wisdom and prosperity to the report which I heard" ((6762c4cd-8fed-4cc5-908f-84b94b6b62cc))
	- (7) This verb may also be used in covenantal formulas, e.g., Ruth summoned God's curse upon herself by saying, "May the Lord do so to me, and more also [yacaph], if anything but death parts mess from you," or literally, "Thus may the Lord do to me, and thus may he add, if ..." ((6762c669-965e-430c-8770-f051e3ef56b1)); cf. ((6762c706-270a-4c41-91bf-aef0c6ff1688)); ((6762c742-5615-4c22-b4f2-3dc109650432)), ((6762c74e-136b-4432-83c1-8bfbc57db95c))
