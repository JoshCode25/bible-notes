- Erotao more frequently suggests
	- (1) that the petitioner is on a footing of equality or familiarity that lends authority to the request with the person whom he intreats. It is used
		- (1a) of a king in making request from another king (Lk 14:32);
		- (1b) of the Pharisee who desired Christ that He would eat with him, indicating the inferior conception he had of Christ (Lk 7:36).
	- (2) It is significant that the Lord Jesus never used [[Greek/aiteo]] in the matter of making request to the Father. The consciousness of His equal dignity, of His potent and prevailing intercession, speaks out in this, that as often as He asks, or declares that He will ask anything of the Father, it is always erotao, an asking, that is, upon equal terms, ((66f4369b-9097-4bd5-8aa7-f1ab4e2968ff)); ((66d1b74b-d6dc-43cb-b3ef-975bf621d5fb)), ((66d3060a-8cd3-4125-92d9-1408ec4acc9d)), ((66d306d9-924d-4e1e-8d5d-cc1388bf5643)), ((66d306af-165e-4f82-937b-aba71cb33f1f))
- (2) Martha, on the contrary, plainly reveals her poor unworthy conception of His person, that.... she ascribes that aiteo to Him which He never ascribes to Himself ((673204a7-d665-4d68-a209-e039b5ffa05c))
