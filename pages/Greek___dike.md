- from [[Greek/deiknuo]]; right (as self-evident), i.e. justice (the principle, a decision, or its execution):
	- judgment (1x)
	- punish + [[Greek/tino]] (1x)
	- vengeance {2x}
- Dike means primarily "custom, usage," came to denote "what is right"; then, "a judicial hearing"; hence, "the execution of a sentence,"
	- (1) "punished," 2 Th 1:9;
	- (2) "condemnation", ((672cb8ad-9253-46f2-b0d8-917411890e19));
	- (3) Jude 7, "vengeance". Some feel that in ((672cba75-7d0a-46e0-b505-06c9fb986ef3)) ("Justice") should be personified to denote the goddess Justice or Nemesis (Lat., Justitia), who the Melita folk supposed was about to inflict the punishment of death upon Paul of means of the viper.
