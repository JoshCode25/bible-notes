- from [[Greek/krino]]; a judge (gen. or spec.). Krites, "a judge", is used
	- (1) of God, Heb 12:23, where the order in the original is "to a Judge who is God of all"; this is really the significance; it suggests that He who is the Judge of His people is at the same time their God; that is the order in 10:30; the word is also used of God in ((669903c4-da3f-4828-a350-0ac84f836e53))
	- (2) of Christ, Acts 10:42; 2 Ti 4:8; ((66990700-2ff7-4d27-b3d0-40c69e41e66f))
	- (3) of a ruler in Israel in the times of the Judges, Acts 13:20;
	- (4) of a Roman procurator, Acts 24:10;
	- (5) of those whose conduct provides a standard of "judging," Mt 12:27; Lk 11:19;
	- (6) in the forensic sense, of one who tries and decides a case, Mt 5:25 (twice); 12:58 (twice); 18:2; 18:6 (lit., "the judge of unrighteousness," expressing subjectively His character); Acts 18:15;
	- (7) of one who passes, or arrogates to himself, judgment on anything, ((66a9633f-6ea7-4922-ae7b-972bbe360045)), ((669903bd-56a5-4aee-ab09-a4a96d20eaa9)) Syn.: Di-kastes (1348) is the more dignified and official term; whereas, krites (2923) gives prominence to the mental process, whether the judge is a magistrate or not.
