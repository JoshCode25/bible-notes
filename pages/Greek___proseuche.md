- Syn.: Deesis (1162) is petitionary, proseuche (4335) is a word of sacred character, being limited to prayer to God, whereas deesis (1162) may also be used of a request addressed to man. Enteuxis (1783) expresses confiding access to God, deesis (1162) gives prominence to the expression of personal need. Proseuche (4335) refers to the element of devotion, enteuxis (1783) to that of childlike confi-dence, by representing prayer as the heart's conversation with God. Several [[Greek/aitema]]ta make up one *proseuche*.
