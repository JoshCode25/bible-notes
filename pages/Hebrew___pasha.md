	- (1) The basic sense of pasha' is to rebel with one of two rebellion's stages in focus:
		- (1a) a goal of independence (2 Kin 1:1), and
		- (1b) the state of independence itself (2 Kin 8:20).
	- (2) A more radical meaning is the state of rebellion in which there is no end of the rebellion in view; it is no longer goal-oriented (1 Kin 12:19).
	- (3) When the act is committed against the Lord it is usually translated "transgress" (Hos 7:13; Is 66:24) and is an expression of an apostate way of life (Is 59:13).
