- Summary: Kosmos is first a harmonious arrangement or order, then by extension, adornment or decoration, and came to denote the world, or the universe, as that which is divinely arranged. It came to mean anyone not of the [[Greek/ekklasia]]. Kosmos, primarily "order, arrangement, ornament, adornment" is used to denote
	- (1) the "earth," e.g., Mt 13:35; Jn 21:25; Acts 17:24; ((66b4b0db-4243-4350-a0c7-5f4db3729258)) (probably here the universe: it had this meaning among the Greeks, owing to the order observable in it); 1 Timothy 6:7; Heb 4:3; 9:26;
	- (2) the "earth" in contrast with Heaven, 1 Jn 3:17 (perhaps also ((66b4b0db-d2d6-437a-aee1-79af847bdb3b)) );

	- (4) "Gentiles" as distinguished from Jews, e.g., Rom 11:12, 15;

	- (6) the "sum of temporal possessions," Mt 16:26; 1 Cor 7:31 (1st part);
