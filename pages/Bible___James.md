	  [[James]], a [[Servant]] of [[God]] and of the [[LORD]] [[Jesus]] [[Christ]],
	  To the [[Twelve]] [[Tribe]]s in [[The Dispersion]]:
	  [[Greet]]ings
	- James 1:2
	  Count it all [[Joy]], [my]([[James]]) [[Brother]]s, when you meet [[Trial]]s of various kinds,
	- James 1:3
	  for you know that the [[Test]]ing of your [[Faith]] [[Produce]]s [[Steadfast]]ness.
		- ((6695061e-a4c1-40d7-bbff-a66371f9bb69))
	- James 1:4
	  And let [[Steadfast]]ness have its full effect, that you may be [[Perfect]] and [[Complete]], lacking in nothing.

	  If any of you lacks [[Wisdom]], let him [[Ask]] [[God]], who [give]([[Gift]]) [[Generous]]ly to all without reproach, and it will be given him.
	- James 1:6
	  id:: 6696582a-88b2-4f9d-844e-4e6a9ca2a3c1
	  But let him [[Ask]] in [[Faith]], with no [[Doubt]]ing, for the one who doubts is like a [[Wave]] of the [[Sea]] that is driven and tossed by the [[Wind]].
	- James 1:7
	  For that person must not suppose that he will [[Receive]] anything from the [[LORD]] ;
	- James 1:8
	  he is a double-minded [[Man]], [[Unstable]] in all his [[Way]]s.
	- James 1:9
	  id:: 6696582a-bf87-40bd-af5c-6a34ea9d33cf
	  Let the lowly [[Brother]] [[Boast]] in his [[Exalt]]ation,
	- James 1:10
	  and the [[Rich]] in his [humiliation]([[Humility]]), because like a [[Flower]] of the [[Grass]] he will pass away.
	- James 1:11
	  For the [[Sun]] [[Rise]]s with its [[Scorch]]ing heat and withers the [[Grass]]; its [[Flower]] falls, and its [[Beauty]] perishes. So also will the [[Rich]] [[Man]] fade away in the midst of his [[Pursuit]]s.
	- James 1:12
	  [[Bless]]ed is the [[Man]] who remains [[Steadfast]] under [[Trial]], for when he has stood the [[Test]] he will [[Receive]] the [[Crown]] of [[Life]], which [[God]] has [[Promise]]d to those who [[Love]] him.
	- James‬ ‭1‬:‭13‬
	  id:: 6682b71b-823c-4da0-b33e-393624c9c67e
	  Let no one say when he is [[Tempt]]ed, “I am being tempted by [[God]],” for God cannot be tempted with [[Evil]], and He Himself tempts no one.
		- ((66869222-2986-4156-9e60-99c292617367)), ((6682e3c1-21f5-494a-a05a-7c44ab9d8fd3))
	- James‬ ‭1‬:‭14‬
	  But each person is [[Tempt]]ed when he is [[Lure]]d and [[Entice]]d by his own [[Desire]].
	- James 1:15
	  id:: 66950f99-fecd-4d7e-9366-cdcfdf53d7b0
	  Then [[Desire]] when it has conceived gives [[Birth]] to [[Sin]], and sin when it is fully [[Grow]]n brings forth [[Death]].
		- ((66951002-acde-4760-a4cc-c225e06b6dd5))
	- James 1:16
	  Do not be [[Deceive]]d, [my]([[James]]) [[Beloved]] [[Brother]]s.
	- James 1:17
	  id:: 6696582a-6473-4185-b147-761d35a516f9
	  Every [[Good]] [[Gift]] and every [[Perfect]] gift is from [above]([[God]]), coming down from the [[Father]] of [[Light]]s with whom there is no variation or [[Shadow]] due to [[Change]].
	- James 1:18
	  Of [His]([[God]]) own [[Will]] he brought us forth by the [[Word]] of [[Truth]], that we should be a kind of [[FirstFruit]]s of his [[Creature]]s.
	- James 1:19
	  [[Know]] this, [my]([[James]]) [[Beloved]] [[Brother]]s: let every person be quick to [[Hear]], [[Slow]] to [[Speak]], slow to [[Anger]];
	- James 1:20
	  for the [[Anger]] of [man]([[Mankind]]) does not [[Produce]] the [[Righteous]]ness of [[God]].
	- James 1:21
	  Therefore put away all filthiness and [[Wicked]]ness and [[Receive]] with [[Meek]]ness the implanted [[Word]], which is able to [[Save]] your [[Soul]]s.
	- James 1:22
	  id:: 66a9633f-0524-4d58-825e-a227d6a617b1
	  But be [[Do]]ers of the [[Word]], and not [[Hear]]ers only, [deceiving]([[Deceive]]) yourselves.
	- James1:23
	  For if anyone is a [[Hear]]er of the [[Word]] and not a [[Do]]er, he is like a [[Man]] who [[Look]]s intently at his [[Natural]] [[Face]] in a [[Mirror]].
	- James 1:24
	  For he [[Look]]s at himself and goes away and at once [[Forget]]s what he was like.
	- James 1:25
	  But the one who [[Look]]s into the [[Perfect]] [[Law]], the law of [liberty]([[Freedom]]), and [[Persevere]]s, being no [[Hear]]er who [[Forget]]s but a [[Do]]er who acts, he will be [[Bless]]ed in his doing.
	- James 1:26
	  If anyone [[Think]]s he is religious and does not bridle his [[Tongue]] but [[Deceive]]s his [[Heart]], this person's [[Religion]] is worthless.
	- James 1:27
	  [[Religion]] that is [[Pure]] and undefiled before [[God]], the [[Father]], is this: to [[Visit]] [[Orphan]]s and [[Widow]]s in their [[Afflict]]ion, and to keep oneself unstained from the [[World]].

	  [My]([[James]]) [[Brother]]s, show no [[Partial]]ity as you hold the [[Faith]] in our [[LORD]] [[Jesus]] [[Christ]], the Lord of [[Glory]].
	- James 2:2
	  For if a [[Man]] wearing a [[Gold]] [[Ring]] and fine [clothing]([[Clothes]]) [[Come]]s into your assembly, and a [[Poor]] man in shabby clothing also comes in,
	- James 2:3
	  and if you pay attention to the one who wears the fine [clothing]([[Clothes]]) and say, "You [[Sit]] here in a [[Good]] place," while you say to the [[Poor]] man, "You [[Stand]] over there," or, "Sit down at my [feet]([[Foot]]),"
	- James 2:4
	  id:: 66a9633f-6ea7-4922-ae7b-972bbe360045
	  have you not then made distinctions among yourselves and become [[Judge]]s with [[Evil]] [[Thought]]s?
	- James 2:5
	  [[Listen]], [my]([[James]]) [[Beloved]] [[Brother]]s, has not [[God]] [chosen]([[Choice]]) those who are [[Poor]] in the [[World]] to be [[Rich]] in [[Faith]] and [[Heir]]s of the [[Kingdom]], which he has [[Promise]]d to those who [[Love]] him?
	- James 2:6
	  But you have [[Dishonor]]ed the [[Poor]] [[Man]]. Are not the [[Rich]] the ones who [[Oppress]] you, and the ones who drag you into [[Court]]?
	- James 2:7
	  Are [they]([[Rich]]) not the ones who [[Blaspheme]] the [[Honor]]able [[Name]] by which you were [[Call]]ed?
	- James 2:8
	  If you really [[Fulfill]] the [[Royal]] [[Law]] according to the [[Scripture]], "You shall [[Love]] your [[Neighbor]] as yourself" you are doing well.
		- ((66a7842c-9a62-4a65-ad06-faf3d1537974))
	- James 2:9
	  But if you show [[Partial]]ity, you are committing [[Sin]] and are [[Convict]]ed by the [[Law]] as [[Transgress]]ors.
	- James 2:10
	  For whoever keeps the whole [[Law]] but [[Fail]]s in one point has become [[Accountable]] for all of it.
	- James 2:11
	  For he who said, '"Do not commit [[Adultery]]," also said, "Do not [[Murder]]." If you do not commit adultery but do murder, you have become a [[Transgress]]or of the [[Law]].
		- ((66ad1c0b-4ec0-447a-9d65-32cb7a6634f9)), ((66ad1c0f-f5ee-4162-8f70-1cdcadfa5c66))
	- James 2:12
	  So [[Speak]] and so act as those who are to be [[Judge]]d under the [[Law]] of [[Liberty]].
	- James 2:13
	  For [[Judgment]] is without [[Mercy]] to one who has shown no mercy. Mercy [[Triumph]]s over judgment.
		- ((66ad131b-f13c-4b48-bba9-9dfccf8c2df5))
	- James 2:14
	  What [[Good]] is it, [my]([[James]]) [[Brother]]s, if someone says he has [[Faith]] but does not have [[Work]]s? Can that faith [[Save]] him?
	- James 2:15
	  If a [[Brother]] or [[Sister]] is poorly clothed and lacking in daily [[Food]] ,
	- James 2:16
	  and one of you says to them, "Go in [[Peace]], be warmed and filled," without [giving]([[Gift]]) them the things [[Need]]ed for the [[Body]], what [[Good]] is that?
	- James 2:17
	  So also [[Faith]] by itself, if it does not have [[Work]]s, is [[Dead]].
	- James 2:18
	  But someone will say, "You have [[Faith]] and I have [[Work]]s." Show [me]([[James]]) your faith apart from your works, and I will show you my faith by my works.
	- James 2:19
	  id:: 66911928-090a-44b5-9cf6-cc11051db452
	  You [[Believe]] that [[God]] is one; you do well. Even the [[Demon]]s believe—and shudder!
	- James 2:20
	  Do you want to be shown, you [[Fool]]ish person, that [[Faith]] apart from [[Work]]s is useless?
	- James 2:21
	  Was not [[Abraham]] our [[Father]] [[Justif]]ied by [[Work]]s when he [[Offer]]ed up his [[Son]] [[Isaac]] on the [[Altar]]?
	- James 2:22
	  You see that [[Faith]] was active along with [his]([[Abraham]]) [[Work]]s, and faith was [[Complete]]d by his works;
	- James 2:23
	  and the [[Scripture]] was [[Fulfill]]ed that says, "[[Abraham]] [[Believe]]d [[God]], and it was counted to him as [[Righteous]]ness"— and he was called a [[Friend]] of God.
		- ((66911a3e-778f-4296-8de4-d96fbe6353b4))
	- James 2:24
	  id:: 669167f3-12f9-4d43-9bf5-81926707d3a4
	  You [[See]] that a person is [[Justif]]ied by [[Work]]s and not by [[Faith]] alone.
	- James 2:25
	  And in the same way was not also [[Rahab]] the [[Prostitute]] [[Justif]]ied by [[Work]]s when she received the [[Messenger]]s and sent them out by another way?
	- James 2:26
	  For as the [[Body]] apart from the [[Spirit]] is [[Dead]], so also [[Faith]] apart from [[Work]]s is dead.

	  Not many of you should become [[Teacher]]s, [my]([[James]]) [[Brother]]s, for you know that we who [[Teach]] will be [[Judge]]d with greater strictness.
	- James 3:2
	  For we all [[Stumble]] in many ways. And if anyone does not stumble in what he says, he is a [[Perfect]] [[Man]], able also to bridle his whole [[Body]].
	- James 3:3
	  If we put bits into the [[Mouth]]s of [[Horse]]s so that they [[Obey]] us, we [[Guide]] their whole [bodies]([[Body]]) as well.
	- James 3:4
	  [[Look]] at the [[Ship]]s also: though they are so large and are driven by [[Strong]] [[Wind]]s, they are [[Guide]]d by a very [[Small]] [[Rudder]] wherever the [[Will]] of the [[Pilot]] [[Direct]]s.
	- James 3:5
	  So also the [[Tongue]] is a [[Small]] [[Member]], yet it [[Boast]]s of great things.
	  How great a [[Forest]] is set ablaze by such a small [[Fire]]!
		- ((669fe771-864f-4f69-a1be-32192136afe7)), ((669a5413-04b9-451d-bed8-88474de220a3))
	- James 3:6
	  id:: 66d05834-b620-42ba-a9db-e493678838bb
	  And the [[Tongue]] is a [[Fire]], a [[World]] of [[Unrighteous]]ness. The tongue is set among our [[Member]]s, [[Stain]]ing the whole [[Body]], setting on fire the entire course of [[Life]], and set on fire by [[Hell]].
	- James 3:7
	  For every kind of [[Beast]] and [[Bird]], of [[reptile]] and [[Sea]] [[Creature]], can be [[Tame]]d and has been tamed by [[Mankind]],
	- James 3:8
	  but no [[Human]] being can [[Tame]] the [[Tongue]]. It is a restless [[Evil]], [[Full]] of [[Dead]]ly [[Poison]].
	- James 3:9
	  With [it]([[Tongue]]) we [[Bless]] our [[LORD]] and [[Father]], and with it we [[Curse]] [[People]] who are [[Made]] in the [likeness]([[Image]]) of [[God]].
	- James 3:10
	  From the same [[Mouth]] [[Come]] [[Bless]]ing and [cursing]([[Curse]]). [My]([[James]]) [[Brother]]s, these things ought not to be so.
	- James 3:11
	  Does a [[Spring]] [[Pour]] forth from the same [[Open]]ing both [[Fresh]] and [[Salt]] [[Water]]?
	- James 3:12
	  Can a [[Fig]] [[Tree]], [my]([[James]]) [[Brother]]s, [[Bear]] [[Olive]]s, or a grapevine produce figs?Neither can a [[Salt]] [[Pond]] [[Yield]] [[Fresh]] [[Water]].
	- James 3:13
	  Who is [[Wise]] and [[Understand]]ing among you? By his [[Good]] conduct let him [[Show]] his [[Work]]s in the [[Meek]]ness of [[Wisdom]].
	- James 3:14
	  But if you have [[Bitter]] [[Jealous]]y and [[Selfish]] [[Ambition]] in your [[Heart]]s, do not [[Boast]] and be [[False]] to the [[Truth]].
	- James 3:15
	  This is not the [[Wisdom]] that [[Come]]s down from above, but is [[Earth]]ly, unspiritual, [[Demon]]ic.
	- James 3:16
	  For where [[Jealous]]y and [[Selfish]] [[Ambition]] [[Exist]], there will be [[Disorder]] and every [[Vile]] [[Practice]].
	- James 3:17
	  id:: 66d05834-0cbb-4de9-8e94-ada4e6ba6b6c
	  But the [[Wisdom]] from above is [[First]] [[Pure]], then [[Peace]]able, [[Gentle]], [[Open]] to [[Reason]], [[Full]] of [[Mercy]] and [[Good]] [[Fruit]]s, impartial and [[Sincere]].
	- James 3:18
	  And a [[Harvest]] of [[Righteous]]ness is [[Sow]]n in [[Peace]] by those who [[Make]] peace.

	  What causes [[Quarrel]]s and what causes [[Fight]]s among you? Is it not this, that your [[Passion]]s are at [[War]] within you?
	- James 4:2
	  id:: 6699029d-e627-49ab-b508-83240dcda086
	  You [[Desire]] and do not have, so you [[Murder]]. You [[Covet]] and cannot obtain, so you [[Fight]] and [[Quarrel]]. You do not have, because you do not [[Ask]].
	- James 4:3
	  id:: 6699027c-2450-4d33-a801-9cf42d6ba6e2
	  You [[Ask]] and do not [[Receive]], because you ask wrongly, to spend it on your [[Passion]]s.
	- James 4:4
	  You adulterous people! Do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity with God? Therefore whoever wishes to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God.
	- James 4:5
	  Or do you suppose it is to no purpose that the Scripture says, "He yearns jealously over the spirit that he has made to dwell in us"?
	- James 4:6
	  But he gives more grace. Therefore it says. “God opposes the proud, but gives grace to the humble."
		- Proverbs 3:34
	- James 4:7
	  Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.
	- James 4:8
	  Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and purify your o hearts, you double-minded.
	- James 4:9
	  Be wretched and mourn and weep. Let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to gloom.
	- James 4:10
	  Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will exalt you.
	- James 4:11
	  id:: 669903bd-56a5-4aee-ab09-a4a96d20eaa9
	  Do not speak evil against one another, brothers. The one who speaks against a brother or judges his brother, speaks evil against the law and judges the law. But if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law but a judge.
	- James 4:12
	  id:: 669903c4-da3f-4828-a350-0ac84f836e53
	  There is only one lawgiver and judge, he who is able to save and to destroy. But who are you to judge your neighbor?
	- James 4:13
	  Come now, you who say, "Today or tomorrow we will go into such and such a town and spend a year there and trade and make a profit"—
	- James 4:14
	  id:: 669904d0-1feb-4e7c-8d8e-25611c037880
	  yet you do not know what tomorrow will bring. What is your life? For you are a mist that appears for a little time and then vanishes.
	- James 4:15
	  Instead you ought to say, "If the Lord wills, we will live and do this or that."
	- James 4:16
	  As it is, you boast in your arrogance. All such boasting is evil.

	  So whoever knows the right thing to do and fails to do it, for him it is sin.

	  Come now, you rich, weep and howl for the miseries that are coming upon you. 
	  James 5:2
	  Your riches have rotted and your garments are moth-eaten.
	- James 5:3
	  Your gold and silver have corroded, and their corrosion will be evidence against you and will eat your flesh like fire. You have laid up treasure in the last days.
	- James 5:4
	  Behold, the wages of the laborers who mowed your fields, which you kept back by fraud, are crying out against you, and the cries of the harvesters have reached the ears of the Lord of hosts.

	  You have lived on the earth in luxury and in self-indulgence. You have fattened your hearts in a day of slaughter.
	- James 5:6
	  You have condemned and murdered the righteous person. He does not resist you.
	- James 5:7
	  Be patient, therefore, brothers, until the coming of the Lord. See how the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth, being patient about it, until it receives the early and the late rains.
	- James 5:8
	  You also, be patient. Establish your hearts, for the coming of the Lord is at hand.
	- James 5:9
	  id:: 66990700-2ff7-4d27-b3d0-40c69e41e66f
	  Do not grumble against one another, brothers, so that you may not be judged; behold, the Judge is standing at the door.
	- James 5:10
	  As an example of suffering and patience, brothers, take the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord.
	- James 5:11
	  Behold, we consider those blessed who remained steadfast. You have heard of the steadfastness of Job, and you have seen the purpose of the Lord, how the Lord is compassionate and merciful.
	- James 5:12
	  But above all, my brothers, do not swear, either by heaven or by earth or by any other oath, but let your "yes" be yes and your "no" be no, so that you may not fall under condemnation.
	- James 5:13
	  Is anyone among you suffering? Let him pray. Is anyone cheerful? Let him sing praise.
	- James 5:14
	  Is anyone among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord.
	- James 5:15
	  And the prayer of faith will save the one who is sick, and the Lord will raise him up. And if he has committed sins, he will be forgiven.
	- James 5:16
	  id:: 669c2b76-7b81-4240-aec9-d6d7d468b8c5
	  Therefore, [[Confess]] your [[Sin]]s to one another and [[Pray]] for one another, that you may of be [[Heal]]ed. The [[Prayer]] of a [[Righteous]] person has great [[Power]] as it is [[Work]]ing.
	- James 5:17
	  Elijah was a man with a nature like ours, and he prayed fervently that it might not rain, and for three years and six months it did not rain on the earth.
	- James 5:18
	  Then he prayed again, and heaven gave rain, and the earth bore its fruit.
	- James 5:19
	  My brothers, if anyone among you wanders from the truth and someone brings him back,
	- James 5:20
	  let him know that whoever brings back a sinner from his wandering will save his soul from death and will cover a multitude of sins.
