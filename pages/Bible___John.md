	  I made known to them your name, and I will continue to make it known, that the love with which you have loved me may be in them, and I in them."

	  Then [He]([[Jesus]]) said to [[Thomas]], "Put your [[Finger]] here, and see my [[Hand]]s; and put out your hand, and place it in my side. Do not disbelieve, but [[Believe]]."
	- John 20:28
	  [[Thomas]] answered [Him]([[Jesus]]), "My [[LORD]] and my [[God]]!"
