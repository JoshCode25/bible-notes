	- 1 Peter 1:2
	  according to the [[Foreknow]]ledge of God the Father, in the sanctification of the Spirit, for obedience to Jesus Christ and for sprinkling with his blood;
	  May grace and peace be multiplied to you.
	- 1 Peter 1:3
	  Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! According to his great mercy, he has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,

	  to an inheritance that is imperishable, undefiled, and unfading, kept in heaven for you,
	- 1 Peter 1:5
	  who by [[God]]'s [[Power]] are being [[Guard]]ed through [[Faith]] for a [[Salvation]] ready to be [[Reveal]]ed in the [[Last Time]].

	  id:: 668297b1-a96e-4f1b-b23e-914592c9acbc
	  In this you [[Rejoice]], though now for a little while, if necessary, you have been [[Grieve]]d by various [[Trial]]s,
	- 1 Peter 1:7
	  id:: 668297c0-fbda-476b-a458-94031e5578f7
	  so that the [[Test]]ed genuineness of your [[Faith]] more precious than [[Gold]] that perishes though it is tested by [[Fire]] —may be found to result in [[Praise]] and [[Glory]] and [[Honor]] at the revelation of [[Jesus]] [[Christ]].
	- 1 Peter 1:8
	  Though you have not seen him, you love him. Though you do not now see him, you believe in him and rejoice with joy that is inexpressible and filled with glory,
	- 1 Peter 1:9
	  obtaining the outcome of your faith, the salvation of your souls.
	- 1 Peter 1:10
	  Concerning this salvation, the prophets who prophesied about the grace that was to be yours searched and inquired carefully,
	- 1 Peter 1:11
	  inquiring what person or time the Spirit of Christ in them was indicating when he predicted the sufferings of Christ and the subsequent glories.
	- 1 Peter 1:12
	  It was revealed to them that they were serving not themselves but you, in the things that have now been announced to you through those who preached the good news to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven, things into which angels long to look.
	- 1 Peter 1:13
	  Therefore, preparing your minds for action, and being sober-minded, set your hope fully on the grace that will be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ.
	- 1 Peter 1:14
	  As obedient children, do not be conformed to the passions of your former ignorance,

	  since it is written, "You shall be holy, for I am holy."

	- 1 Peter 1:17
	  And if you call on him as Father who judges impartially according to each one's deeds, conduct yourselves with fear throughout the time of your exile,
	- 1 Peter 1:18
	  knowing that you were ransomed from the futile ways inherited from your forefathers, not with perishable things such as silver or gold,
	- 1 Peter 1:19
	  but with the precious blood of Christ, like that of a lamb without blemish or spot.
	- 1 Peter 1:20
	  [He]([[Christ]]) was [[Foreknow]]n before the foundation of the world but was made manifest in the [[Last Time]]s for the sake of you

	  who through him are believers in God, who raised him from the dead and gave him glory, so that your faith and hope are in God.
	- 1 Peter 1:22
	  Having purified your souls by your obedience to the truth for a sincere brotherly love, love one another earnestly from a pure heart,
	- 1 Peter 1:23
	  id:: 66c4878e-c609-4df6-91d7-fe5d2b4d76aa
	  since you have been born again, not of perishable seed but of imperishable, through the living and abiding word of God;
	- 1 Peter 1:24
	  for
	  ”All flesh is like grass
	  and all its glory like the flower of grass.
	  The grass withers,
	  and the flower falls,

	  but the word of the Lord remains forever."
	  And this word is the good news that was preached to you.

	  So put away all malice and all deceit and hypocrisy and envy and all slander.

	  Like newborn infants, long for the pure spiritual milk, that by it you may grow up into salvation—

	  if indeed you have tasted that the Lord is good.
	- 1 Peter 2:4
	  As you come to him, a living stone rejected by men but in the sight of God chosen and precious,
	- 1 Peter 2:5
	  you yourselves like living stones are being built up as a spiritual house, to be a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.
		- ((66c488f7-74b6-44c1-b97f-0258d8243702))
	- 1 Peter 2:6
	  For it stands in Scripture:
	  "Behold, I am laying in Zion a stone,
	  a cornerstone chosen and precious,
	  and whoever believes in him will not be put to shame."
		- ((66aa7b9d-5c3a-4dff-8f70-f85dec143c30))

	  So the honor is for you who believe, but for those who do not believe,

	  Once you were not a people, but now you are God's people; once you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy.
	- 1 Peter 2:11
	  Beloved, I urge you as sojourners and exiles to abstain from the passions of the flesh, which wage war against your soul.
	- 1 Peter 2:12
	  Keep your conduct among the Gentiles honorable, so that when they speak against you as evildoers, they may see your good deeds and glorify God on the day of visitation.
	- 1 Peter 2:13
	  Be subject for the Lord's sake to every human institution, whether it be to the emperor as supreme,
	- 1 Peter 2:14
	  or to governors as sent by him to punish those who do evil and to praise those who do good.
	- 1 Peter 2:15
	  For this is the will of God, that by doing good you should put to silence the ignorance of foolish people.
	- 1 Peter 2:16
	  Live as people who are free, not using your freedom as a cover-up for evil, but livIng as servants of God.

	- 1 Peter 2:18
	  Servants, be subject to your masters with all respect, not only to the good and gentle but also to the unjust.
	- 1 Peter 2:19
	  For this is a gracious thing, when, mindful of God, one endures sorrows while suffering unjustly.
	- 1 Peter 2:20
	  For what credit is it if, when you sin and are beaten for it, you endure? But if when you do good and suffer for it you endure, this is a gracious thing in the sight of God.
	- 1 Peter 2:21
	  For to this you have been called, because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example, so that you might follow in his steps.
	- 1 Peter 2:22
	  He committed no sin, neither was deceit found in his mouth.
	- 1 Peter 2:23
	  When he was reviled, he did not revile in return; when he suffered, he did not threaten, but continued entrusting himself to him who judges justly.

	  [He]([[Christ]]) himself [bore]([[Bear]]) our [[Sin]]s in his [[Body]] on the [[Tree]], that we might [[Die]] to [[Sin]] and [[Live]] to [[Righteous]]ness. By his [[Wound]]s you have been [[Heal]]ed,

	- 1 Peter 3:3
	  Do not let your adorning be external— the braiding of hair and the putting on of gold jewelry, or the clothing you wear -
	- 1 Peter 3:4
	  but let your adorning be the hidden person of the heart with the imperishable beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which in God's sight is very precious.
	- 1 Peter 3:5
	  For this is how the holy women who hoped in God used to adorn themselves, by submitting to their own husbands,
	- 1 Peter 3:6
	  as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord. And you are her children, if you do good and do not fear anything that is frightening.
	- 1 Peter 3:7
	  Likewise, husbands, live with your wives an understanding way, showing honor to the woman as the weaker vessel, since they are heirs with you of the grace of life, so that your prayers may not be hindered.
	- 1 Peter 3:8
	  Finally, all of you, have unity of mind, sympathy, brotherly love, a tender heart, and a humble mind.

	  Do not repay evil for evil or reviling for reviling, but on the contrary, bless, for to this you were called, that you may obtain a blessing.

	  For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous,
	  and his ears are open to their prayer.

	  Now who is there to harm you if you are zealous for what is good?

	  But even if you should [[Suffer]] for righteousness' sake, you will be blessed. Have no fear of them, nor be troubled,
	- 1 Peter 3:15
	  but in your hearts honor Christ the Lord as holy, always being prepared to make a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope that is in you; yet do it with gentleness and respect,
	- 1 Peter 3:16
	  having a good conscience, so that, when you are slandered, those who revile your good behavior in Christ may be put to shame.
	- 1 Peter 3:17
	  For it is better to [[Suffer]] for doing good, if that should be God's will, than for doing evil.
	- 1 Peter 3:18
	  For Christ also [[Suffer]]ed once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh but made alive in the spirit,
	- 1 Peter 3:19
	  in which he went and proclaimed to the spirits in prison,
	- 1 Peter 3:20
	  because they formerly did not obey, when God's patience waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was being prepared, in which a few, that is, eight persons, were brought safely through water.

	  [[Baptism]], which corresponds to this, now saves you, not as a removal of dirt from the body but as an appeal to God for a good conscience, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,

	  With respect to this they are surprised when you do not join them in the same flood of debauchery, and they malign you;

	  So I exhort the elders among you, as a fellow elder and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, as well as a partaker in the glory that is going to be revealed:

	  shepherd the flock of God that is among you, exercising oversight, not under compulsion, but willingly, as God would have you; not for shameful gain, but eagerly;
