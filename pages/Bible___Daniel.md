	- Daniel 10:1
	  In the [[Third]] [[Year]] of [[Cyrus]] [[King]] of [[Persia]] a [[Word]] was [[Reveal]]ed to [[Daniel]], who was [[Name]]d [[Belteshazzar]]. And the word was [[True]], and it was a great [[Conflict]]. And he understood the word and had [[Understand]]ing of the [[Vision]].
	- Daniel 10:2
	  In those days I, [[Daniel]], was [[Mourn]]ing for [[Three]] weeks.
	- Daniel 10:3
	  I [ate]([[Eat]]) no delicacies, no [[Meat]] or [[Wine]] [[Enter]]ed [my]([[Daniel]]) [[Mouth]], nor did I anoint myself at all, for the full [[Three]] weeks.
	- Daniel 10:4
	  On the twenty-fourth day of the [[First]] month, as [I]([[Daniel]]) was [[Stand]]ing on the bank of the great [[River]] (that is, the [[Tigris]])
	- Daniel 10:5
	  id:: 66981cdc-c952-4744-b45c-a0f18f8b7938
	  [I]([[Daniel]]) lifted up my [[Eye]]s and [[Look]]ed, and behold, a [[Man]] clothed in [[Linen]], with a [[Belt]] of fine [[Gold]] from [[Uphaz]] around [His]([[Christ]]) waist.
	- Daniel 10:6
	  id:: 669ad3c5-3f4f-4237-b6c5-bc28626f083a
	  [His]([[Christ]]) [[Body]] was like [[Beryl]], his [[Face]] like the appearance of [[Lightning]], his [[Eye]]s like flaming torches, his [[Arm]]s and [[Leg]]s like the gleam of burnished [[Bronze]], and the [[Sound]] of his [[Word]]s like the sound of a multitude.

	- Daniel 10:7
	  And I, [[Daniel]], alone [saw]([[See]]) the [[Vision]], for the men who were with me did not see the vision, but a great [[Trembl]]ing fell upon them, and they [fled]([[Flee]]) to [[Hide]] themselves.
	- Daniel 10:8
	  So [I]([[Daniel]]) was left [[Alone]] and [saw]([[See]]) this great [[Vision]], and no [[Strength]] was left in me. My radiant [[Appear]]ance was fearfully [[Change]]d, and I retained no strength.
	- Daniel 10:9
	  Then [I]([[Daniel]]) [[Hear]]d the [[Sound]] of [His]([[Christ]]) [[Word]]s, and as I heard the sound of his words, I fell on my [[Face]] in deep [[Sleep]] with my face to the [[Ground]].
	- Daniel 10:10
	  And behold, a [[Hand]] [[Touch]]ed [me]([[Daniel]]) and set me [[Trembl]]ing on my [[Hand]]s and [[Knee]]s.
	- Daniel 10:11
	  And [He]([[Christ]]) said to me, “O [[Daniel]], [[Man]] greatly [[Love]]d,  [[Understand]] the [[Word]]s that I [[Speak]] to you, and [[Stand]] upright, for now I have been sent to you.” And when he had spoken this word to me, I stood up [[Trembl]]ing.
	- Daniel 10:12
	  Then [He]([[Christ]]) said to me, “[[Fear]] not, [[Daniel]], for from the [[First]] [[Day]] that you set your [[Heart]] to [[Understand]] and [[Humble]]d yourself before your [[God]], your [[Word]]s have been [[Hear]]d, and I have [[Come]] because of your words.
	- Daniel 10:13
	  The [[Prince]] of the [[Kingdom]] of [[Persia]] withstood [Me]([[Christ]]) [[Twenty-One]] [[Day]]s, but [[Michael]], one of the chief princes, came to [[Help]] me, for I was left there with the [[King]]s of Persia,
	- Daniel 10:14
	  and came to make [you]([[Daniel]]) [[Understand]] what is to happen to your [[People]]  in the latter [[Day]]s. For the [[Vision]] is for days yet to come.”
	- Daniel 10:15
	  When [He]([[Christ]]) had [spoken]([[Speak]]) to [me]([[Daniel]]) according to these [[Word]]s, I turned my [[Face]] toward the [[Ground]] and was [[Mute]].
	- Daniel 10:16
	  And behold, one in the likeness of the [[Children]] of [[Man]]  [[Touch]]ed [my]([[Daniel]]) [[Lip]]s. Then I opened my [[Mouth]] and [spoke]([[Speak]]). I said to [him]([[Christ]]) who stood before me, “O my [[LORD]], by reason of the [[Vision]] [[Pain]]s have come upon me, and I retain no [[Strength]].
	- Daniel 10:17
	  How can [my]([[Daniel]]) [lord]([[Christ]])'s [[Servant]] [[Talk]] with my [[LORD]]? For now no [[Strength]] remains in me, and no [[Breath]] is left in me.”
	- Daniel 10:18
	  Again [one]([[Christ]]) having the [[Appear]]ance of a [[Man]] [[Touch]]ed [me]([[Daniel]]) and [[Strength]]ened me.
	- Daniel 10:19
	  And [He]([[Christ]]) said, “O [[Man]] greatly [[Love]]d, [[Fear]] not, [[Peace]] be with [you]([[Daniel]]); be [[Strong]] and of [[Good]] [[Courage]].” And as he spoke to me, I was [[Strength]]ened and said, “Let my [[LORD]] [[Speak]], for you have strengthened me.”
	- Daniel 10:20
	  Then [He]([[Christ]]) said, “Do [you]([[Daniel]]) [[Know]] why I have [[Come]] to you? But now I will return to [[Fight]] [[Against]] the [[Prince]] of [[Persia]]; and when I go out, behold, the prince of  [[Greece]] will come.
	- Daniel 10:21
	  But [I]([[Christ]]) will tell [you]([[Daniel]]) what is inscribed in the [[Book]] of [[Truth]]: there is none who contends by my side [[Against]] these except [[Michael]], your [[Prince]].
