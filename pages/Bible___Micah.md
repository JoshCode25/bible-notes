	  But you, O [[Bethlehem]] [[Ephrathah]],
	  who are too [little]([[Small]]) to be among the [[Clan]]s of [[Judah]],
	  from you shall [[Come]] forth for [Me]([[God]])
	  [one]([[Christ]]) who is to be [[Ruler]] in [[Israel]],
	  whose coming forth is from of [[Old]],
	  from [[Ancient]] [[Day]]s.
