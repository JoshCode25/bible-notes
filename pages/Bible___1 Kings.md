	  [He]([[Elijah]]) said, “I have been very [[Jealous]] for the [[LORD]], the [[God]] of hosts. For the [[People]] of [[Israel]] have [[Forsake]]n your [[Covenant]], thrown down your [[Altar]]s, and [[Kill]]ed your [[Prophet]]s with the [[Sword]], and I, even I only, am left, and they [[Seek]] my [[Life]], to [[Take]] it away."
	- 1 Kings 19:11
	  And [He]([[God]]) said, "Go out and stand on the [mount]([[Mountain]]) before the [[LORD]]." And behold, the LORD passed by, and a great and [[Strong]] [[Wind]] tore the mountains and broke in pieces the [[Rock]]s before the LORD, but the LORD was not in the [[Wind]]. And after the wind an [[Earthquake]], but the LORD was not in the earthquake.
	- 1 Kings 19:12
	  And after the [[Earthquake]] a [[Fire]], but the [[LORD]] was not in the fire. And after the fire the [[Sound]] of a low [[Whisper]].

	  And when [[Elijah]] [[Hear]]d [it]([[Whisper]]), he wrapped his [[Face]] in his [[Cloak]] and went out and stood at the entrance of the [[Cave]]. And behold, there came a [[Voice]] to him and said, "What are you doing here, Elijah?"

	  [He]([[Elijah]]) said, "I have been very [[Jealous]] for the [[LORD]], the [[God]] of hosts.

	- 1 Kings 19:15
	  And the [[LORD]] said to [him]([[Elijah]]), "Go, return on your [[Way]] to the [[Wilderness]] of [[Damascus]]. And when you [[Arrive]], you shall [[Anoint]] [[Hazael]] to be [[King]] over [[Syria]].
	- 1 Kings 19:16
	  And [[Jehu]] the [[Son]] of [[Nimshi]] [you]([[Elijah]]) shall [[Anoint]] to be [[King]] over [[Israel]], and [[Elisha]] the [[Son]] of [[Shaphat]] of [[Abel-meholah]] you shall anoint to be [[Prophet]] in your place.
	- 1 Kings 19:17
	  And the one who [[Escape]]s from the [[Sword]] of [[Hazael]] shall [[Jehu]] put to [[Death]], and the one who escapes from the sword of Jehu shall [[Elisha]] put to death.

	  Yet [I]([[God]]) will leave [[Seven]] [[Thousand]] in [[Israel]], all the [[Knee]]s that have not [[Bow]]ed to [[Baal]], and every [[Mouth]] that has not [[Kiss]]ed him."
	- 1 Kings 19:19
	  So [he]([[Elijah]]) departed from there and [found]([[Find]]) [[Elisha]] the [[Son]] of [[Shaphat]], who was [[Plow]]ing with [[Twelve]] [[Yoke]] of [[Ox]]en in front of him, and he was with the twelfth. Elijah passed by him and cast his [[Cloak]] upon him.
	- 1 Kings 19:20
	  And [he]([[Elisha]]) left the [[Ox]]en and [ran]([[Run]]) after [[Elijah]] and said, "Let me [[Kiss]] my [[Father]] and my [[Mother]], and then I will [[Follow]] you." And he said to him, "Go back again, for what have I done to you?"
	- 1 Kings 19:21
	  And [he]([[Elisha]]) returned from [[Follow]]ing [him]([[Elijah]]) and took the [[Yoke]] of [[Ox]]en and [[Sacrifice]]d them and [[Boil]]ed their [[Flesh]] with the yokes of the oxen and [gave]([[Gift]]) it to the [[People]], and they [ate]([[Eat]]). Then he arose and went after Elijah and [[Assist]]ed him.

	  [[Ben-hadad]] the [[King]] of [[Syria]] [[Gather]]ed all his [[Army]] together. [[Thirty]]-[[Two]] kings were with him, and [[Horse]]s and [[Chariot]]s. And he went up and closed in on [[Samaria]] and [fought]([[Fight]]) [[Against]] it.
	- 1 Kings 20:2
	  id:: 6749bb2a-0f7a-4e35-a11b-02cd0472dbb3
	  And [he]([[Ben-hadad]]) [[Sent]] [[Messenger]]s into the [[City]] to [[Ahab]] [[King]] of [[Israel]] and said to him, "Thus says Ben-hadad:
	- 1 Kings 20:3
	  '[Your]([[Ahab]]) [[Silver]] and your [[Gold]] are [mine]([[Ben-hadad]]); your best [wives]([[Wife]]) and [[Children]] also are mine.’"

	  And the [[King]] of [[Israel]] [[Answer]]ed, "As [you]([[Ben-hadad]]) say, [my]([[Ahab]]) lord, O king, I am yours, and all that I have."
	- 1 Kings 20:5
	  The [[Messenger]]s came again and said, "Thus says [[Ben-hadad]]: ‘I sent to [you]([[Ahab]]), saying, "[[Deliver]] to me your [[Silver]] and your [[Gold]], your [wives]([[Wife]]) and your [[Children]]."
	- 1 Kings 20:6
	  Nevertheless [I]([[Ben-hadad]]) will send my [[Servant]]s to you tomorrow about this [[Time]], and they shall [[Search]] [your]([[Ahab]]) [[House]] and the houses of your [[Servant]]s and lay [[Hand]]s on whatever [[Please]]s you and [[Take]] it away.'"
	- 1 Kings 20:19
	  So these went out of the [[City]], the [[Servant]]s of the [[Governor]]s of the [[District]]s and the [[Army]] that [[Follow]]ed them.
	- 1 Kings 20:20
	  And each [struck]([[Strike]]) down his [[Man]]. The [[Syria]]ns [fled]([[Flee]]), and [[Israel]] [[Pursue]]d them, but [[Ben-hadad]] [[King]] of Syria [[Escape]]d on a [[Horse]] with horsemen.
	- 1 Kings 20:21
	  And [the]([[Ahab]]) [[King]] of [[Israel]] went out and [struck]([[Strike]]) the [[Horse]]s and [[Chariot]]s, and struck the [[Syria]]ns with a great blow.
	- 1 Kings 20:22
	  Then the [[Prophet]] came near to [the]([[Ahab]]) [[King]] of [[Israel]] and said to him, "Come, [[Strength]]en yourself, and [[Consider]] well what you have to do, for in the [[Spring]] [the]([[Ben-hadad]]) king of [[Syria]] will come up [[Against]] you."
	- 1 Kings 20:23
	  And the [[Servant]]s of the [[King]] of [[Syria]] said to [him]([[Ben-hadad]]), "[Their]([[Israel]]) [gods]([[God]]) are gods of the [[Hill]]s, and so they were [[Strong]]er than we. But let us [[Fight]] [[Against]] them in the [[Plain]], and surely we shall be stronger than they.
	- 1 Kings 20:24
	  And do this: [[Remove]] the [[King]]s, each from his post, and put [[Commander]]s in their places,
	- 1 Kings 20:25
	  and muster an [[Army]] like the army that [you]([[Ben-hadad]]) have [[Lost]], [[Horse]] for horse, and [[Chariot]] for chariot. Then we will [[Fight]] [[Against]] them in the [[Plain]], and surely we shall be [[Strong]]er than they." And he [[Listen]]ed to [their]([[Servant]]) [[Voice]] and did so.
