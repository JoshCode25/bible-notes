	  For this is the [[Will]] of [[God]], your [[Sanctif]]ication: that you abstain from [[Sexual]] [[Immoral]]ity;
	- 1 Thessalonians 4:4
	   that each one of you [[Know]] how to [[Control]] his own [[Body]] in [Holiness]([[Holy]]) and [[Honor]]
	- 1 Thessalonians 4:11
	  and to aspire to [[Live]] [[Quiet]]ly, and to [[Mind]] your own affairs, and to [[Work]] with your [[Hand]]s, as we instructed you,
	- 1 Thessalonians 4:12
	  so that you may [[Walk]] properly before outsiders and be [[Depend]]ent on no one.
