	  For we [[Know]] that if the [[Tent]] that is our [[Earth]]ly [[Home]] is [[Destroy]]ed, we have a [[Building]] from [[God]], a [[House]] not [[Made]] with [[Hand]]s, [[Etern]]al in the [[Heaven]]s.

	- 2 Corinthians 5:2
	  For in this [[Tent]] we [[Groan]], longing to put on our [[Heaven]]ly [[Dwell]]ing,
	- 2 Corinthians 5:3
	  if indeed by putting it on we may not be [found]([[Find]]) [[Naked]].
	- 2 Corinthians 5:4
	  For while we are still in this [[Tent]], we [[Groan]], being [[Burden]]ed â€”not that we would be unclothed, but that we would be further clothed, so that what is [[Mortal]] may be swallowed up by [[Life]].
	- 2 Corinthians 5:5
	  He who has [[Prepare]]d us for this very thing is [[God]], who has [given]([[Gift]]) us the [Spirit]([[Holy Spirit]]) as a [[Guarantee]].

	  So we are always of [[Good]] [[Courage]]. We [[Know]] that while we are at [[Home]] in the [[Body]] we are away from the [[LORD]],
	- 2 Corinthians 5:7
	  for we [[Walk]] by [[Faith]], not by [sight]([[See]]).
	- 2 Corinthians 5:8
	  Yes, we are of [[Good]] [[Courage]], and we would rather be away from the [[Body]] and at [[Home]] with the [[LORD]].
	- 2 Corinthians 5:9
	  So whether we are at [[Home]] or away, we make it our [aim]([[Focus]]) to [[Please]] [Him]([[God]]).
	- 2 Corinthians 5:10
	  For we must all [[Appear]] before the [[Judgment]] seat of [[Christ]], so that each one may [[Receive]] what is due for what he has done in the [[Body]], whether [[Good]] or [[Evil]].

	  Therefore, if anyone is in [[Christ]], he is a [[New]] [[Creation]]. The [[Old]] has passed way; behold, the [[New]] has [[Come]].
	- 2 Corinthians 5:18
	  All this is from [[God]], who through [[Christ]] [[Reconcil]]ed us to himself and [gave]([[Gift]]) us the [[Ministry]] of reconciliation;
	- 2 Corinthians 5:19
	  that is, in [[Christ]] [[God]] was [[Reconcil]]ing the [[World]] to himself, not counting their [[Trespass]]es [[Against]] them, and [entrusting]([[Trust]]) to us the [[Message]] of reconciliation.
	- 2 Corinthians 5:20
	  Therefore, we are [[Ambassador]]s for [[Christ]], [[God]] making his [[Appeal]] through us. We implore you on behalf of Christ, be [[Reconcil]]ed to God.
	- 2 Corinthians 5:21
	  For our sake he [[Made]] [Him]([[Christ]]) to be [[Sin]] who [knew]([[Know]]) no sin, so that in him we might become the [[Righteous]]ness of [[God]].

	  For [[God]]ly [[Grief]] [[Produce]]s a  [[Repent]]ance that [[Lead]]s to [[Salvation]] without [[Regret]], whereas [[World]]ly grief produces [[Death]].
	- 2 Corinthians 7:11
	  id:: 672a162e-4813-42a2-a0e2-fa5cf275c83d
	  For [[See]] what earnestness this [[God]]ly [[Grief]] has [[Produce]]d in you, but also what eagerness to clear yourselves, what indignation, what [[Fear]], what longing, what [[Zeal]], what [[Punish]]ment! At every point you have [[Prove]]d yourselves [[Innocent]] in the matter.

	  Not that we dare to classify or compare ourselves with some of those who are commending themselves. But when they [[Measure]] themselves by one another and [[Compar]]e themselves with one another, they are without [[Understand]]ing.

	- 2 Corinthians 10:1
	  I, Paul, myself entreat you, by the meekness and gentleness of Christ - I who am humble when face to face with you, but bold toward you when I am away! -
	- 2 Corinthians 10:2
	  I beg of you that when I am present I may not have to show boldness with such confidence as I count on showing against some who suspect us of walking according to the flesh.
	- 2 Corinthians 10:3
	  For though we [[Walk]] in the [[Flesh]], we are not waging [[War]] according to the flesh.
	- 2 Corinthians 10:4
	  For the [[Weapon]]s of our [warfare]([[Spiritual Warfare]]) are not of the [[Flesh]] but have [[Divine]] [[Power]] to [[Destroy]] [[Stronghold]]s.
	- 2 Corinthians 10:5
	  We [[Destroy]] arguments and every lofty [[Opinion]] [[Raise]]d [[Against]] the [[Knowledge]] of [[God]], and take every [[Thought]] [[Captive]] to [[Obey]] [[Christ]],
	- 2 Corinthians 10:6
	  being ready to [[Punish]] every [[Disobedience]], when your [[Obedience]] is [[Complete]].
	- 2 Corinthians 10:7
	  Look at what is before your eyes. If anyone is confident that he is Christ's, let him remind himself that just as he is Christ's, so also are we.
	- 2 Corinthians 10:8
	  For even if I boast a little too much of our authority, which the Lord gave for building you up and not for destroying you, I will not be ashamed. 2
	- Corinthians 10:9
	  I do not want to appear to be frightening you with my letters.
