	- Romans 1:1
	  [[Paul]], a [[Servant]] of [[Christ]] [[Jesus]], [[Call]]ed to be an [[Apostle]], set apart for the [[Gospel]] of [[God]],
	- Romans 1:2
	  which [He]([[God]]) [[Promise]]d beforehand through his [[Prophet]]s in the [[Holy]] [[Scripture]]s,
	- Romans 1:3
	  concerning [His]([[God]]) [[Son]], [who]([[Christ]]) was descended from [[David]] according to the [[Flesh]]
	- Romans 1:4
	  and was declared to be the [[Son]] of [[God]] in [[Power]] according to the [Spirit]([[Holy Spirit]]) of [holiness]([[Holy]]) by his [[Resurrect]]ion from the [[Dead]], [[Jesus]] [[Christ]] our [[LORD]],
	- Romans 1:5
	  through [whom]([[Christ]]) we have [[Receive]]d [[Grace]] and [[Apostle]]ship to bring about the [[Obedience]] of [[Faith]] for the sake of [His]([[God]]) [[Name]] among all the [[Nation]]s,
	- Romans 1:6
	  Including you who are [[Call]]ed to [[Belong]] to [[Jesus]] [[Christ]],
	- Romans 1:7
	  To all those in [[Rome]] who are [[Love]]d by [[God]] and [[Call]]ed to be [[Saint]]s:
	  [[Grace]] to you and [[Peace]] from [[God]] our [[Father]] and the [[LORD]] [[Jesus]] [[Christ]].
	- Romans 1:8
	  First, [I]([[Paul]]) [[Thank]] my [[God]] through [[Jesus]] [[Christ]] for all of you, because your [[Faith]] is proclaimed in all the [[World]].
	- Romans 1:9
	  For [[God]] is [my]([[Paul]]) [[Witness]], whom I [[Serve]] with my [[Spirit]] in the [[Gospel]] of [His]([[Christ]]) [[Son]], that without ceasing I mention you
	- Romans 1:10
	  always in [my]([[Paul]]) [[Prayer]]s, [[Ask]]ing that somehow by [[God]]'s [[Will]] I may now at last succeed in [coming]([[Come]]) to you.
	- Romans 1:11
	  For [I]([[Paul]]) long to [[See]] you, that I may impart to you some [[Spiritual]] [[Gift]] to [[Strength]]en you—
	- Romans 1:12
	  that is, that we may be mutually [[Encourage]]d by each other's [[Faith]], both yours and [mine]([[Paul]]).
	- Romans 1:13
	  [I]([[Paul]]) do not want you to be unaware, [[Brother]]s, that I have often intended to [[Come]] to you (but thus far have been prevented), in order that I may [[Reap]] some [[Harvest]] among you as well as among the rest of the [[Gentile]]s.
	- Romans 1:14
	  [I]([[Paul]]) am under obligation both to [[Greek]]s and to [[Barbarian]]s, both to the [[Wise]] and to the [[Fool]]ish.
	- Romans 1:15
	  So [I]([[Paul]]) am eager to [[Preach]] the [[Gospel]] to you also who are in [[Rome]].
	- Romans 1:16
	  For [I]([[Paul]]) am not [ashamed]([[Shame]]) of the [[Gospel]], for it is the [[Power]] of [[God]] for [[Salvation]] to everyone who [[Believe]]s, to the [[Jew]] [[First]] and also to the [[Greek]].
	- Romans 1:17
	  id:: 66b4b0db-2131-419b-9de3-8f9947b11e65
	  For in [it]([[Gospel]]) the [[Righteous]]ness of [[God]] is [[Reveal]]ed from [[Faith]] for faith, "as it is [[Written]], "The righteous shall [[Live]] by faith."
		- ((66814381-2a9e-4156-818e-de584bf59de0))
	- Romans 1:18
	  id:: 6695596f-3164-4a81-9737-e994d75f13fd
	  For the [[Wrath]] of [[God]] is [[Reveal]]ed from [[Heaven]] against all ungodliness and [[Unrighteous]]ness of [men]([[Mankind]]), who by their unrighteousness [[Suppress]] the [[Truth]].
	- Romans 1:19
	  For what can be [[Know]]n about [[God]] is plain to them, because God has [shown]([[Reveal]]) it to [them]([[Mankind]]).
	- Romans 1:20
	  id:: 66b4b0db-4243-4350-a0c7-5f4db3729258
	  For [His]([[God]]) [[Invisible]] [[Attribute]]s, namely, his [[Etern]]al [[Power]] and [[Divine]] [[Nature]], have been clearly [perceived]([[See]]), ever since the [[Creation]] of the [[World]], in the things that have been [[Made]]. So [they]([[Mankind]]) are without [[Excuse]].
	- Romans 1:21
	  For although [they]([[Mankind]]) [knew]([[Know]]) [[God]], they did not [[Honor]] him as God or [give]([[Gift]]) [[Thank]]s to him, but they became futile in their [[Think]]ing, and their [[Fool]]ish [[Heart]]s were [[Dark]]ened.
	- Romans 1:22
	  Claiming to be [[Wise]], [they]([[Mankind]]) became [[Fool]]s,
	- Romans 1:23
	  id:: 66b4b0db-4b2f-433a-ab9a-e32f70e1580c
	  and exchanged the [[Glory]] of the [[Immortal]] [[God]] for [[Image]]s resembling [[Mortal]] [man]([[Mankind]]) and [[Bird]]s and [[Animal]]s and creeping things.
	- Romans 1:24
	  Therefore [[God]] gave them up in the [[Lust]]s of their [[Heart]]s to [impurity]([[Immoral]]), to the [[Dishonor]]ing of their [bodies]([[Body]]) among themselves,
	- Romans 1:25
	  because [they]([[Mankind]]) exchanged the [[Truth]] about [[God]] for a [[Lie]] and [[Worship]]ed and [[Serve]]d the [[Creature]] rather than the [[Creator]], who is [[Bless]]ed [[Forever]]! [[Amen]].
	- Romans 1:26
	  For this [[Reason]] [[God]] gave [them]([[Mankind]]) up to [[Dishonor]]able [[Passion]]s. For their [women]([[Woman]]) exchanged [[Natural]] [relations]([[Sexual]]) for those that are contrary to [[Nature]];
	- Romans 1:27
	  and the [men]([[Man]]) likewise gave up [[Natural]] [relations]([[Sexual]]) with [women]([[Woman]]) and were consumed with [[Passion]] for one another, men committing [shameless]([[Shame]]) acts with men and [receiving]([[Receive]]) in themselves the due [[Penalty]] for their [[Error]].
	- Romans 1:28
	  id:: 66b4b0db-bcec-4744-a2f2-95f7ff0462a5
	  And since [they]([[Mankind]]) did not [[See]] fit to acknowledge [[God]], God gave them up to a debased [[Mind]] to do what ought not to be done.
	- Romans 1:29
	  [They]([[Mankind]]) were [[Fill]]ed with all manner of [[Unrighteous]]ness, [[Evil]], [[Covet]]ousness, [[Malice]]. They are full of [[Envy]], [[Murder]], strife, [deceit]([[Deceive]]), maliciousness. They are [[Gossip]]s,
	- Romans 1:30
	  id:: 66b4b0db-02ed-4564-9d14-8859ab0f9cc3
	  [[Slander]]ers, [[Hate]]rs of [[God]], insolent, [haughty]([[Arrogant]]), [[Boast]]ful, [[Invent]]ors of [[Evil]] [disobedient]([[Disobedience]]) to [[Parent]]s,
	- Romans 1:31
	  [[Fool]]ish, [faithless]([[Doubt]]), [[Heart]]less, ruthless.
	- Romans 1:32
	  Though [they]([[Mankind]]) [[Know]] [[God]]'s [[Righteous]] [[Decree]] that those who [[Practice]] such things [[Deserve]] to [[Die]], they not only do them but give approval to those who practice them.
- Romans 2
	- Romans 2:1
	  Therefore you have no [[Excuse]], O [man]([[Mankind]]), every one of you who [[Judge]]s. For in passing [[Judgment]] on another you [[Condemn]] yourself, because you, the judge, [[Practice]] the very same things.
	- Romans 2:2
	  We [[Know]] that the [[Judgment]] of [[God]] rightly falls on those who [[Practice]] such things.
	- Romans 2:3
	  Do you suppose, O [man]([[Mankind]])—you who [[Judge]] those who [[Practice]] such things and yet do them yourself—that you will [[Escape]] the [[Judgment]] of [[God]]?
	- Romans 2:4
	  id:: 66ad131b-f13c-4b48-bba9-9dfccf8c2df5
	  Or do you presume on the [[Rich]]es of [His]([[God]]) [[Kind]]ness and forbearance and [[Patience]], not [[Know]]ing that God's kindness is [meant]([[Purpose]]) to [[Lead]] you to [[Repent]]ance?
	- Romans 2:5
	  But because of your [[Hard]] and impenitent [[Heart]] you are storing up [[Wrath]] for yourself on the [[Day]] of wrath when [[God]]'s [[Righteous]] [[Judgment]] will be [[Reveal]]ed.
		- ((6683e9da-eaa7-43ee-b92b-4862388c99a3))
	- Romans 2:6
	  [He]([[God]]) will render to each one according to his [[Work]]s:
		- ((6683e97c-d019-4526-92b1-cd378a6d3cac))
	- Romans 2:7
	  to those who by [[Patience]] in well-doing [[Seek]] for [[Glory]] and [[Honor]] and [[Immortal]]ity, [He]([[God]]) will [give]([[Gift]]) [[Etern]]al [[Life]];
	- Romans 2:8
	  but for those who are [self-seeking]([[Selfish]]) and do not [[Obey]] the [[Truth]], but obey [[Unrighteous]]ness, there will be [[Wrath]] and fury.
	- Romans 2:9
	  There will be [[Tribulation]] and [[Distress]] for every [[Human]] being who does [[Evil]], the [[Jew]] [[First]] and also the [[Greek]],
	- Romans 2:10
	  but [[Glory]] and [[Honor]] and [[Peace]] for everyone who does [[Good]], the [[Jew]] [[First]] and also the [[Greek]].
	- Romans 2:11
	  For [[God]] shows no [[Partial]]ity.
		- ((66a6f052-4e35-4664-82a7-d6299b1f3f06))
	- Romans 2:12
	  id:: 66b4b0db-ebf7-482a-a7b2-e3855199c5aa
	  For all who have [[Sin]]ned without the [[Law]] will also [[Perish]] without the law, and all who have sinned under the law will be [[Judge]]d by the law.
	- Romans 2:13
	  id:: 66b4b0db-038d-4f08-b32b-219494e3373b
	  For it is not the [[Hear]]ers of the [[Law]] who are [[Righteous]] before [[God]], but the doers of the law who will be [[Justif]]ied.
		- ((66a9633f-0524-4d58-825e-a227d6a617b1)), ((669167f3-12f9-4d43-9bf5-81926707d3a4))
	- Romans 2:14
	  id:: 66ad607a-f39d-48a5-a4a8-37269fba100f
	  For when [[Gentile]]s, who do not have the [[Law]], by [[Nature]] do what the law requires, they are a law to themselves, even though they do not have the law.
	- Romans 2:15
	  id:: 66ad607a-f2ff-4f6c-8673-0fb64321c3db
	  [They]([[Gentile]]) show that the [[Work]] of the [[Law]] is [[Written]] on their [[Heart]]s, while their [[Conscience]] also [[Bear]]s [[Witness]], and their conflicting [[Thought]]s [[Accuse]] or even [[Excuse]] them
	- Romans 2:16
	  on that [[Day]] when, according to [my]([[Paul]]) [[Gospel]], [[God]] [[Judge]]s the [[Secret]]s of [men]([[Mankind]]) by [[Christ]] [[Jesus]].
		- ((6683e97c-d019-4526-92b1-cd378a6d3cac))
	- Romans 2:17
	  id:: 66b4b0db-ea7a-4041-94e0-21613d12694c
	  But if you [[Call]] yourself a [[Jew]] and rely on the [[Law]] and [[Boast]] in [[God]]
	- Romans 2:18
	  id:: 66b4b0db-07a4-41be-8f38-f3ddccd34d3d
	  and [[Know]] [His]([[God]]) [[Will]] and approve what is excellent, because you are [[Instruct]]ed from the [[Law]];
	- Romans 2:19
	  id:: 66b4b0db-a49c-49ca-b422-b70f9954992b
	  and if you are sure that you yourself are a [[Guide]] to the [[Blind]], a [[Light]] to those who are in [[Dark]]ness,
	- Romans 2:20
	  id:: 66b4b0db-bdcc-404a-bc9f-c6501d6d0e67
	  an [[Instruct]]or of the [[Fool]]ish, a [[Teacher]] of [[Children]], having in the [[Law]] the embodiment of [[Knowledge]] and [[Truth]] —
	- Romans 2:21
	  you then who [[Teach]] others, do you not teach yourself? While you [[Preach]] against stealing, do you [[Steal]]?
	- Romans 2:22
	  You who say that one must not commit [[Adultery]], do you commit adultery? You who abhor [[Idol]]s, do you [[Rob]] temples?
	- Romans 2:23
	  id:: 66b4b0db-dffb-4fbe-8d8a-c91495844dd4
	  You who [[Boast]] in the [[Law]] [[Dishonor]] [[God]] by [[Break]]ing the law.
	- Romans 2:24
	  For, as it is [[Written]], "The [[Name]] of [[God]] is [[Blaspheme]]d among the [[Gentile]]s because of you."
		- ((668d259b-2bae-4c35-aa0a-62ca4dfc1821))
	- Romans 2:25
	  For [circumcision]([[Circumcise]]) indeed is of [[Value]] if you [[Obey]] the [[Law]], but if you [[Break]] the law, your circumcision becomes [uncircumcision]([[Uncircumcise]]).
	- Romans 2:26
	  id:: 66b4b0db-3f51-47b4-8f35-5ee73b09a58b
	  So, if a [[Man]] who is [[Uncircumcise]]d keeps the precepts of the [[Law]], will not his uncircumcision be regarded as [circumcision]([[Circumcise]])?
	- Romans 2:27
	  Then he who is [[Physical]]ly [[Uncircumcise]]d but keeps the [[Law]] will [[Condemn]] you who have the [[Written]] [[Code]] and [circumcision]([[Circumcise]]) but [[Break]] the law.
	- Romans 2:28
	  id:: 66a788b6-8324-4030-9b4d-61858d7e6fe8
	  For no one is a [[Jew]] who is merely one outwardly, nor is [circumcision]([[Circumcise]]) outward and [[Physical]].
	- Romans 2:29
	  id:: 66a788bc-8c55-4eeb-9a9e-29248d5f1d20
	  But a [[Jew]] is one inwardly, and [circumcision]([[Circumcise]]) is a matter of the [[Heart]], by the [Spirit]([[Holy Spirit]]), not by the [[Letter]]. His [[Praise]] is not from [man]([[Mankind]]) but from [[God]].
- Romans 3
  collapsed:: true
	- Romans 3:1
	  Then what advantage has the [[Jew]]? Or what is the [[Value]] of [circumcision]([[Circumcise]])?
	- Romans 3:2
	  Much in every way. To begin with, the [[Jew]]s were [entrusted]([[Trust]]) with the [[Oracle]]s of [[God]].
	- Romans 3:3
	  id:: 66b4b0db-a417-41a0-9333-a9fa3cc4caac
	  What if some were [[Unfaithful]]? Does [their]([[Jew]]) faithlessness nullify the [[Faithful]]ness of [[God]]?
	- Romans 3:4
	  By no means! Let [[God]] be [[True]] though every one were a [[Liar]], as it is [[Written]],
	  "That you may be [[Justif]]ied in your [[Word]]s, 
	  and prevail when you are [[Judge]]d."
		- ((66b4d09f-fd64-414f-9776-caec2fb0004e))
	- Romans 3:5
	  But if our [[Unrighteous]]ness serves to [[Show]] the [[Righteous]]ness of [[God]], what shall we say? That God is unrighteous to inflict [[Wrath]] on us? ([I]([[Paul]]) [[Speak]] in a [[Human]] [[Way]].)
	- Romans 3:6
	  By no means! For then how could [[God]] [[Judge]] the [[World]]?
	- Romans 3:7
	  But if through [my]([[Paul]]) [[Lie]] [[God]]'s [[Truth]] [[Abound]]s to his [[Glory]], why am I still being [[Condemn]]ed as a [[Sin]]ner?
	- Romans 3:8
	  And why not do [[Evil]] that [[Good]] may [[Come]]? - as some people [[Slander]]ously charge us with saying. Their [[Condemn]]ation is just.
	- Romans 3:9
	  id:: 66b4b0db-558a-4fb7-aa82-7293e808c14d
	  What then? Are we [[Jew]]s any better off? No, not at all. For we have already charged that all, both Jews and [[Greek]]s, are under [[Sin]],
	- Romans 3:10

	  Now we [[Know]] that whatever the [[Law]] says it [[Speak]]s to those who are under the law, so that every [[Mouth]] may be stopped, and the whole [[World]] may be held [[Accountable]] to [[God]].
	- Romans 3:20
	  For by [[Work]]s of the [[Law]] no [[Human]] being will be [[Justif]]ied in his sight, since through the law comes [[Knowledge]] of [[Sin]].
	- Romans 3:21
	  id:: 66b4b0db-8c57-4168-bc2c-7d08b48d3ee8
	  But now the [[Righteous]]ness of [[God]] has been [[Manifest]]ed apart from the law, although the [[Law]] and the [[Prophet]]s [[Bear]] [[Witness]] to it-
	- Romans 3:22
	  the [[Righteous]]ness of [[God]] through [[Faith]] in [[Jesus]] [[Christ]] for all who [[Believe]]. For there is no distinction:
	- Romans 3:23
	  id:: 66b4b0db-452f-49ca-8786-37e91569096a
	  for all have [[Sin]]ned and fall short of the [[Glory]] of [[God]],
	- Romans 3:24
	  and are [[Justif]]ied by [His]([[God]]) [[Grace]] as a [[Gift]], through the [redemption]([[Redeem]]) that is in [[Christ]] [[Jesus]],
	- Romans 3:25
	  id:: 66b4b0db-2f19-41ac-aca5-b3b72835d118
	  whom [[God]] put forward as a [[Propitiation]] by [Him]([[Christ]]) [[Blood]], to be [[Receive]]d by [[Faith]]. This was to [[Show]] God's [[Righteous]]ness, because in his [[Divine]] [[Forbear]]ance he had passed over former [[Sin]]s.
	- Romans 3:26
	  id:: 66b4b0db-e2f6-4c6d-aebe-fc0b16106e72
	  It was to [[Show]] [His]([[God]]) [[Righteous]]ness at the [[Present]] [[Time]], so that he might be just and the [[Justif]]ier of the one who has [[Faith]] in [[Jesus]].
	- Romans 3:27
	  id:: 66bc240a-35cc-43e4-a358-bf244ff9f260
	  Then what becomes of our [[Boast]]ing? It is excluded. By what kind of [[Law]]? By a law of [[Work]]s? No, but by the law of [[Faith]].
	- Romans 3:28
	  For we hold that one is [[Justif]]ied by [[Faith]] apart from [[Work]]s of the [[Law]].
	- Romans 3:29
	  Or is [[God]] the God of [[Jew]]s only? Is he not the God of [[Gentile]]s also? Yes, of Gentiles also,
	- Romans 3:30
	  since [[God]] is [[One]] — who will [[Justif]]y the [[Circumcise]]d by [[Faith]] and the [[Uncircumcise]]d through faith.
	- Romans 3:31
	  Do we then overthrow the [[Law]] by this [[Faith]]? By no means! On the contrary, we uphold the law.

	  What shall we say then was gained by [[Abraham]], our forefather according to the [[Flesh]]?
	- Romans 4:2
	  For if [[Abraham]] was [[Justif]]ied by [[Work]]s, he has something to [[Boast]] about, but not before [[God]] .
	- Romans 4:3
	  For what does the [[Scripture]] say? "[[Abraham]] [[Believe]]d [[God]], and it was counted to him as [[Righteous]]ness."
		- ((66911a3e-778f-4296-8de4-d96fbe6353b4))
	- Romans 4:4
	  Now to the one who [[Work]]s, his [[Wage]]s are not counted as a [[Gift]] but as his due.
	- Romans 4:5
	  And to the one who does not [[Work]] but [[Believe]]s in [Him]([[God]]) who [[Justif]]ies the ungodly, his [[Faith]] is counted as [[Righteous]]ness,
	- Romans 4:6
	  just as [[David]] also speaks of the [[Bless]]ing of the one to whom [[God]] counts [[Righteous]]ness apart from [[Work]]s:
	- Romans 4:7
	  " [[Bless]]ed are those whose lawless deeds are [[Forgive]]n,
	  and whose [[Sin]]s are [[Cover]]ed;

	- Romans 4:9
	  Is this [[Bless]]ing then only for the [[Circumcise]]d, or also for the [[Uncircumcise]]d? For we say that [[Faith]] was counted to [[Abraham]] as [[Righteous]]ness.
	- Romans 4:10
	  How then was it counted to [him]([[Abraham]])? Was it before a or after he had been [[Circumcise]]d? It was not after, but before he was circumcised.
	- Romans 4:11
	  [He]([[Abraham]]) received the [[Sign]] of circumcision as a [[Seal]] of the [[Righteous]]ness that he had by [[Faith]] while he was still [[Uncircumcise]]d. The [[Purpose]] was to make him the [[Father]] of all who [[Believe]] without being circumcised, so that righteousness would be counted to them as well,
	- Romans 4:12
	  and to make [him]([[Abraham]]) the [[Father]] of the [[Circumcise]]d who are not merely circumcised but who also [[Walk]] in the footsteps of the [[Faith]] that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised.
