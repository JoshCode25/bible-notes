- from a primary nemo, (to parcel out, espec. food or grazing to animals); law (through the idea of prescriptive usage), gen. (regulation), spec. (of Moses (incl the volume]; also of the Gospel), or fig. (a principle):
	- law (197x)
- Nomos, in the NT is used
	- (1) of "law" in general,
		- (1a) e.g., ((66b4b0db-ebf7-482a-a7b2-e3855199c5aa)) - ((66b4b0db-038d-4f08-b32b-219494e3373b)), expressing a general principle relating to "law";
		- (1b) ((66bc240a-35cc-43e4-a358-bf244ff9f260)) 3:27, "By what kind of law?" i.e., "by what sort of principle (has the glorying been excluded)?";
		- (1c) ((66b4b0db-cedd-4a94-a8f8-4418efeca8e8)), referring to the period between Adam's trespass and the giving of the Law;
		- (1d) ((66b4b322-1fbe-4a0f-bf69-0593078dada2)) against those graces which constitute the fruit of the Spirit "there is no law," ((673746a9-affc-47a4-ae45-b02a3aa7e2bf));
		- (1e) the ostensible aim of the law is to restrain the evil tendencies natural to man in his fallen estate, yet in experience law finds itself not merely ineffective, it actually provokes those tendencies to greater activity. The intention of the gift of the Spirit is to constrain the believer to a life in which the natural tendencies shall have no place, and to produce in him their direct contraries. Law, therefore, has nothing to say against the fruit of the Spirit; hence the believer is not only not under law, ((673748c1-01e6-4428-ac0e-a8a96cc47b11)), the law finds no scope in his life, inasmuch as, and in so far as, he is led by the Spirit
	- (2) of a force or influence impelling to action, ((66b4b0db-5bf6-41f1-a839-34c587627d87)), ((66b4b0db-0eda-4c18-886a-f788f9b58969)) (1st part), "a different law";
