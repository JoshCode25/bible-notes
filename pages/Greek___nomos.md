- from a primary nemo, (to parcel out, espec. food or grazing to animals); law (through the idea of prescriptive usage), gen. (regulation), spec. (of Moses (incl the volume]; also of the Gospel), or fig. (a principle):
	- law (197x)
- Nomos, in the NT is used
	- (1) of "law" in general,
		- (1a) e.g., ((66b4b0db-ebf7-482a-a7b2-e3855199c5aa)) - ((66b4b0db-038d-4f08-b32b-219494e3373b)), expressing a general principle relating to "law";
		- (1b) ((66bc240a-35cc-43e4-a358-bf244ff9f260)) 3:27, "By what kind of law?" i.e., "by what sort of principle (has the glorying been excluded)?";
		- (1c) ((66b4b0db-cedd-4a94-a8f8-4418efeca8e8)), referring to the period between Adam's trespass and the giving of the Law;
		- (1d) ((66b4b322-1fbe-4a0f-bf69-0593078dada2)) against those graces which constitute the fruit of the Spirit "there is no law," ((673746a9-affc-47a4-ae45-b02a3aa7e2bf));
		- (1e) the ostensible aim of the law is to restrain the evil tendencies natural to man in his fallen estate, yet in experience law finds itself not merely ineffective, it actually provokes those tendencies to greater activity. The intention of the gift of the Spirit is to constrain the believer to a life in which the natural tendencies shall have no place, and to produce in him their direct contraries. Law, therefore, has nothing to say against the fruit of the Spirit; hence the believer is not only not under law, ((673748c1-01e6-4428-ac0e-a8a96cc47b11)), the law finds no scope in his life, inasmuch as, and in so far as, he is led by the Spirit
	- (2) of a force or influence impelling to action, ((66b4b0db-5bf6-41f1-a839-34c587627d87)), ((66b4b0db-0eda-4c18-886a-f788f9b58969)) (1st part), "a different law";
	- (3) of the Mosaic Law, the "law" of Sinai,
		- (3a) with the definite article, e.g., Mt 5:18; Jn 1:17; ((66ad607a-f2ff-4f6c-8673-0fb64321c3db)), ((66b4b0db-07a4-41be-8f38-f3ddccd34d3d)), ((66b4b0db-bdcc-404a-bc9f-c6501d6d0e67)), ((66b4b0db-3f51-47b4-8f35-5ee73b09a58b)); ((66b4b0db-ee68-481d-bfdc-2588b16e2cb8)); ((66b4b0db-9567-43bb-bcb2-316a3c1ef575)); ((66b4b356-9d8c-406b-bc95-0ce3c5539d2b)), ((66b4b3de-a905-4936-922c-9568e1f3a361)), ((66b4b504-38c5-4c5c-9614-d19df9564296)), ((66cb0f9b-f95f-43fd-8ec4-5fe0cc8967d2)), ((66b4b0db-2c32-42dc-a7e9-acfb1e7e6ff8)); ((66b4b0db-3432-432e-a90b-d89fe2d31a76)), ((66b4b0db-c307-47e1-90e9-d9edafdedcb5)), ((66b4b0db-56b0-4bec-9eca-a9e4ce2b68aa)); Gal 3:10, 12, 19, 21, 24; 5:3; ((66a2536b-eabd-4f33-b3ab-a7d27d89bcbc)); Phil 3:6; 1 Ti 1:8; Heb 7:19; ((66a9633f-eb6d-4024-a901-cd4350f0649b));
		- (3b) without the article, thus stressing the Mosaic Law in its quality as "law," e.g., ((66ad607a-f39d-48a5-a4a8-37269fba100f)) (1st part); ((66bc240a-eb59-4823-b734-2fdee01ab70e)); ((66b4b4aa-981f-4fb1-9ea3-9eca6f5e9992)), where the stress in the quality lies in this, that "the commandment which was unto (i.e., which he thought would be a means of) life," he found to be "unto (i.e., to have the effect of revealing his actual state of) death"; ((66b4b0db-9416-47bd-8325-f0a316edc0c6)); 1 Cor 9:20; Gal 2:16, 19, 21; 3:2, 5, 10 (1st part), 11, 18, 23; 4:4, 5, 21 (1st part); 5:4, 18; 6:13; Phil 3:5, 9; Heb 7:16; 9:19; ((66ad607a-2707-4ac8-a176-ad25fe76cafe)); ((669903bd-56a5-4aee-ab09-a4a96d20eaa9)); (in regard to the statement in Gal 2:16, that "a man is not justified by the works of the Law," the absence of the article before nomos indicates the assertion of a principle, "by obedience to law," but evidently the Mosaic Law is in view. Here the apostle is maintaining that submission to circumcision entails the obligation to do the whole "Law." Circumcision belongs to the ceremonial part of the "Law," but, while the Mosaic Law is actually divisible into the ceremonial and the moral, no such distinction is made or even assumed in Scripture. The statement maintains the freedom of the believer from the "law" of Moses in its totality as a means of justification);
	- (4) by metonymy, of the books which contain the "law,"
		- (4a) of the Pentateuch, e.g., Mt 5:17; 12:5; Lk 16:16; 24:44; Jn 1:45; ((66b4b0db-8c57-4168-bc2c-7d08b48d3ee8)); Gal 3:10;
		- (4b) of the Psalms, Jn 10:34; 15:25;
		- (4c) of the Psalms, Isaiah, Ezekiel and Daniel, 12:34, the Psalms and Isaiah, ((66b4b0db-ee68-481d-bfdc-2588b16e2cb8)) (with vv. 10-18); Isaiah, 1 Cor 14:21;
	- (5) from all this it may be inferred that "the law" in the most comprehensive sense was an alternative title to "The Scriptures."
	- (6) The following phrases specify "laws" of various kinds;
		- (6a) "the law of Christ," Gal 6:2, i.e.,
			- (6a1) either given by Him (as in the Sermon on the Mount and in Jn 13:14, 15; 15:4), or
			- (6a2) the "law" or principle by which Christ Himself lived (Mt 20:28; Jn 13:1); these are not actual alternatives, for the "law" imposed by Christ was always that by which He Himself lived in the "days of His flesh." He confirmed the "Law" as being of divine authority (cf. Mt 5:18); yet He presented a higher standard of life than perfunctory obedience to the current legal rendering of the "Law," a standard which, without annulling the "Law," He embodied in His own character and life (see, e.g., Mt 5:21-48; this breach with legalism is especially seen in regard to the ritual or ceremonial part of the "Law" in its wide scope); He showed Himself superior to all human interpretations of it;
		- (6b) "a law of faith," ((66bc240a-35cc-43e4-a358-bf244ff9f260)), i,e., a principle which demands only faith on man's part;
		- (6c) "the law of my mind," ((66b4b0db-0eda-4c18-886a-f788f9b58969)), that principle which governs the new nature in virtue of the new birth;
		- (6d) "the law of sin," ((66b4b0db-0eda-4c18-886a-f788f9b58969)), the principle by which sin exerts its influence and power despite the desire to do what is right;
		- (6e) "of sin and death," ((66b4b0db-87b5-4ae0-887f-ddac0f603762)), death being the effect;
		- (6f) "the law of liberty," ((66a9633f-ec82-4cff-af11-0206b486aeca)); ((66ad607a-306b-4f13-9e63-68a75626d961)), a term comprehensive of all the Scriptures, not a "law" of compulsion enforced from without, but meeting with ready obedience through the desire and delight of the renewed being who is subject to it; into it he looks, and in its teaching he delights; he is "under law (ennomos, "in law," implying union and subjection) to Christ," 1 Cor 9:21; cf, e.g., Ps 119:32, 45, 97; 2 Cor 3:17;
		- (6g) "the royal law," ((66a9633f-3f56-4bab-a6ea-7a6a89513448)), i.e., the "law" of love, royal in the majesty of its power, the "law" upon which all others hang, Mt 22:34-40; ((66cd4870-3f11-4c62-8032-5e31186a81a4)); ((673b3bd9-c558-4cee-b970-463bf705096e));
		- (6h) "the law of the Spirit of life," ((66b4b0db-87b5-4ae0-887f-ddac0f603762)), i.e., the animating principle by which the Holy Spirit
