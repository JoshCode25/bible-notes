- Jude 5
  Now [I]([[Jude]]) want to [[Remind]] you, although you once fully knew it, that [[Jesus]], who [[Saved]] a [[People]] out of the land of [[Egypt]], afterward [[Destroy]]ed those who did not [[Believe]].
- Jude 6
  And the [[Angel]]s who did not stay within their own position of [[Authority]], but left their proper dwelling, [He]([[Jesus]]) has kept in [[Etern]]al [[Chain]]s under gloomy [[Dark]]nes until the [[Judgment]] of the great [[Day]] â€”
- Jude 7
  just as [[Sodom]] and [[Gomorrah]] and the surrounding cities, which likewise indulged in [[Sexual]] [[Immoral]]ity and [[Pursue]]d unnatural [[Desire]], serve as an example by undergoing a [[Punish]]ment of [[Etern]]al [[Fire]].

- Jude 17
  But you must [[Remember]], [[Beloved]], the [[Predict]]ions of the [[Apostle]]s of our [[LORD]] [[Jesus]] [[Christ]].
- Jude 18
  [They]([[Apostle]]) said to you, "In the [[Last]] [[Time]] there will be [[Scoff]]ers, [[Follow]]ing their own [[Ungodly]] [[Passion]]s."
- Jude 19
  It is [these]([[Scoff]]) who cause [divisions]([[Divide]]), [[World]]ly [[People]], [devoid]([[Void]]) of the [Spirit]([[Holy Spirit]]).

  But you, [[Beloved]], [[Build]]ing yourselves up in your most [[Holy]] [[Faith]] and [[Praying]] in the [[Holy Spirit]],
- Jude 21
  [[Keep]] yourselves in the [[Love]] of [[God]], [[Wait]]ing for the [[Mercy]] of our [[LORD]] [[Jesus]] [[Christ]] that [[Lead]]s to [[Etern]]al [[Life]].
- Jude 22
  And have [[Mercy]] on those who [[Doubt]];
- Jude 23
  [[Save]] others by snatching them out of the [[Fire]]; to others show [[Mercy]] with [[Fear]], [hating]([[Hate]]) even the [[Garment]] [[Stain]]ed by the [[Flesh]].
- Jude 24
  Now to [Him]([[God]]) who is able to [[Keep]] you from [stumbling]([[Stumble]]) and to [[Present]] you [[Blameless]] before the [[Presence]] of his [[Glory]] with great [[Joy]],
- Jude 25
  to the only [[God]], our [[Savior]], through [[Jesus]] [[Christ]] our [[LORD]], be [[Glory]], [[Majest]]y, [[Dominion]], and [[Authority]], before all [[Time]] and now and [[Forever]]. [[Amen]].
