  #Eschatology
	- 2 Thessalonians 1:5
	  This is evidence of the [[Righteous]] [[Judgment]] of [[God]], that you may be considered [[Worthy]] of the [[Kingdom]] of God, for which you are also [[Suffer]]ingâ€”
	- 2 Thessalonians 1:6
	  since indeed [[God]] considers it [Just]([[Justice]]) to repay with affliction those who [[Afflict]] you,
	- 2 Thessalonians 1:7
	  and to grant [[Relief]] to you who are [[Afflict]]ed as well as to us, when the [[LORD]] [[Jesus]] is [[Reveal]]ed from [[Heaven]] with His [[Might]]y [[Angel]]s
		- ((6683ee2d-201e-47c3-9d34-fbb601d84caa))
	- 2 Thessalonians 1:8
	  in flaming [[Fire]], inflicting [[Vengeance]] on those who do not [[Know]] [[God]] and on those who do not [[Obey]] the [[Gospel]] of our [[LORD]] [[Jesus]].
	- 2 Thessalonians 1:9
	  They will [[Suffer]] the [[Punish]]ment of [[Etern]]al [destruction]([[Destroy]]), away from the [[Presence]] of the [[LORD]] and from the [[Glory]] of His [[Might]],
		- ((6683e9da-eaa7-43ee-b92b-4862388c99a3))
	- 2 Thessalonians 1:10
	  when [He]([[Jesus]]) comes on that day to be [glorified]([[Glory]]) in His [[Saint]]s, and to be [[Marvel]]ed at among all who have [[Believe]]d, because our [[Testimony]] to you was believed.
	- 2 Thessalonians 1:11
	  To this end we always [[Pray]] for you, that our [[God]] may make you [[Worthy]] of His [[Calling]] and may [[Fulfill]] every resolve for [[Good]] and every [[Work]] of [[Faith]] by His [[Power]],
		- ((6683e8c0-fc76-496e-b1b6-01186d94ae90))
	- 2 Thessalonians 1:12
	  so that the [[Name]] of our [[LORD]] [[Jesus]] may be [glorified]([[Glory]]) in you, and you in Him, according to the [[Grace]] of our [[God]] and the [[LORD]] [[Jesus]] [[Christ]] .
- 2 Thessalonians 2
	- 2 Thessalonians 2:16
	  Now may our [[LORD]] [[Jesus]] [[Christ]] Himself, and [[God]] our [[Father]], who [[Love]]d us and gave us [[Etern]]al [[Comfort]] and [[Good]] [[Hope]] through [[Grace]],
	- 2 Thessalonians 2:17
	  [[Comfort]] your [[Heart]]s and [[Establish]] them in every [[Good]] [[Work]] and [[Word]].
