		- (1b) The prophetical works are very moderate in their usage of malak, with the outstanding exception of the Book of Zechariah, where the angel of the Lord communicates God's message to Zechariah.

Often several messengers are sent together: "… and he sent messengers [pl. of malak]…” ((6745c53b-eaa1-4795-b75a-ee849e952103))
	- (3) The introductory formula of the message borne by the malak often contains the phrase "Thus says....." or "This is what ... says," signifying the authority of the messenger in giving the message of his master: "Thus says Jephthah:…" ((6745c7c6-0937-4f0f-8d48-e872528976ad))
	- (4) As a representative of a king, the malak might have performed the function of a diplomat.

		- (7b) Two angels came to Lot at Sodom: "And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground.." (Gen 19:1).
		- (7c) The angels were also commissioned to protect God's people: "For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways" (Ps 91:11).
	- (8) Most significant, are the phrases malak Yahweh, "the angel of the LORD," and malak elohim, "the angel of God."
		- (8a) The phrase is always used in the singular.
		- (8b) It denotes an angel who had mainly a saving and protective function: "For mine angel shall go before thee, and bring thee in unto the Amorites, and the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites: and I will cut them off" (Ex 23:23),
		- (8c) He might also bring about destruction: "And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of the LORD stand between the earth and the heaven, having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders of Israel, who were clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces.” (1 Chr 21:16)
		- (8d) The relation between the Lord and the "angel of the LORD" is often so close that it is difficult to separate the two (Gen 16:7ff.; 21:17ff.; 22:11ff.; 31:11ff.; Ex 3:2ff.; Judg 6:11ff.; 13:21f.). This identification has led some interpreters to conclude that the "angel of the LORD" was the pre-incarnate Christ.
