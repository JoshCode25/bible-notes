	  Then [[Israel]] [[Sent]] [[Messenger]]s to [[Sihon]] [[King]] of the [[Amorite]]s, saying,
	- Numbers 21:22
	  id:: 6745c157-8c41-478d-aadf-9f6356357ef5
	  "Let [me]([[Israel]]) pass through [your]([[Sihon]]) [[Land]]. We will not turn aside into [[Field]] or [[Vineyard]]. We will not [[Drink]] the [[Water]] of a [[Well]]. We will go by the [[King]]'s [[Highway]] until we have passed through your territory."
	- Numbers 21:23
	  id:: 6745c1d5-bc6d-4b36-bdc0-7df7cce5f86c
	  But [[Sihon]] would not allow [[Israel]] to pass through his territory. He [[Gather]]ed all his [[People]] together and went out [[Against]] Israel to the [[Wilderness]] and [came]([[Come]]) to [[Jahaz]] and [fought]([[Fight]]) against Israel.
	- Numbers 21:24
	  id:: 6745c1e3-c13a-4580-96c7-c50cd9eceddb
	  And [[Israel]] [[Defeat]]ed [him]([[Sihon]]) with the edge of the [[Sword]] and [took]([[Take]]) [[Possess]]ion of his [[Land]] from the [[Arnon]] to the [[Jabbok]], as far as to the [[Ammonite]]s, for the border of the Ammonites was [[Strong]].
	- Numbers 21:25
	  And [[Israel]] [took]([[Take]]) all these [cities]([[City]]), and Israel settled in all the cities of the [[Amorite]]s, in [[Heshbon]], and in all its [[Village]]s.
	- Numbers 21:26
	  For [[Heshbon]] was the [[City]] of [[Sihon]] the [[King]] of the [[Amorite]]s, who had [fought]([[Fight]]) [[Against]] the former king of [[Moab]] and [[Take]]n all his [[Land]] out of his [[Hand]], as far as the [[Arnon]].
	- Numbers 21:31
	  Thus [[Israel]] [[Live]]d in the [[Land]] of the [[Amorite]]s.
	- Numbers 21:32
	  And [[Moses]] [[Sent]] to [[Spy]] out [[Jazer]], and [they]([[Israel]]) [[Capture]]d its [[Village]]s and dispossessed the [[Amorite]]s who were there.
	- Numbers 21:33
	  Then [they]([[Israel]]) turned and went up by the [[Way]] to [[Bashan]]. And [[Og]] the [[King]] of Bashan [came]([[Come]]) out [[Against]] them, he and all his [[People]], to [[Battle]] at [[Edrei]].
	- Numbers 21:34
	  But the [[LORD]] said to [[Moses]], "Do not [[Fear]] [him]([[Og]]), for I have [given]([[Gift]]) him into your [[Hand]], and all his [[People]], and his [[Land]]. And you shall do to him as you did to [[Sihon]] [[King]] of the [[Amorite]]s, who [[Live]]d at [[Heshbon]]."
	- Numbers 21:35
	  So [they]([[Israel]]) [[Defeat]]ed [him]([[Og]]) and his [[Son]]s and all his [[People]], until he had no [survivor]([[Survive]]) left. And they [[Possess]]ed his [[Land]].
