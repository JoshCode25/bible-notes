	  Do not be [[Deceive]]d: [[God]] is not [[Mock]]ed, for whatever one [[Sow]]s, that will he also [[Reap]].
	- Galatians 6:8
	  For the one who [[Sow]]s to his own [[Flesh]] will from the flesh [[Reap]] [[Corrupt]]ion, but the one who sows to the [Spirit]([[Holy Spirit]]) will from the Spirit reap [[Etern]]al [[Life]].
