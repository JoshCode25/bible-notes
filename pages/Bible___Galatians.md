	  Are you so [[Fool]]ish? Having begun by the [Spirit]([[Holy Spirit]]) , are you now being [[Perfect]]ed by the [[Flesh]]?
- Galatians 4
	- Galatians 4:8
	  Formerly, when you did not [[Know]] [[God]], you were [enslaved]([[Slave]]) to those that by [[Nature]] are not gods.
	- Galatians 4:9
	  But now that you have [[Come]] to [[Know]] [[God]], or rather to be known by God, how can you turn back again to the [[Weak]] and [[Worthless]] [[Elementary]] [[Principle]]s of the [[World]], whose [[Slave]]s you want to be once more?

- Galatians 5
	- Galatians 5:13
	  For you were [[Call]]ed to [[Freedom]], [[Brother]]s. Only do not use your freedom as an opportunity for the [[Flesh]], but through [[Love]] [[Serve]] one another.
	- Galatians 5:14
	  id:: 673b3bd9-c558-4cee-b970-463bf705096e
	  For the whole [[Law]] is [[Fulfill]]ed in [[One]] [[Word]]: "You shall [[Love]] your [[Neighbor]] as yourself"
		- ((66a7842c-9a62-4a65-ad06-faf3d1537974))
	- Galatians 5:15
	  But if you [[Bite]] and [[Devour]] one another, [[Watch]] out that you are not [[Consume]]d by one another.
	- Galatians 5:16
	  But [I]([[Paul]]) say, [[Walk]] by the [Spirit]([[Holy Spirit]]), and you will not gratify the [[Desire]]s of the [[Flesh]].
	- Galatians 5:17
	  For the [[Desire]]s of the [[Flesh]] are [[Against]] the [Spirit]([[Holy Spirit]]), and the desires of the Spirit are against the flesh, for these are [[Oppose]]d to each other, to [[Keep]] you from doing the things you [[Want]] to do.

	- Galatians 5:18
	  id:: 673748c1-01e6-4428-ac0e-a8a96cc47b11
	  But if you are [led]([[Lead]]) by the [Spirit]([[Holy Spirit]]), you are not under the [[Law]].
	- Galatians 5:19
	  Now the [[Work]]s of the [[Flesh]] are evident: [[Sexual]] [[Immoral]]ity, [impurity]([[Impure]]), sensuality,
	- Galatians 5:20
	  [[Idolat]]ry, sorcery, [[Enmity]], strife, [[Jealous]]y, fits of [[Anger]], rivalries, dissensions, divisions,
	- Galatians 5:21
	  [[Envy]], [[Drunk]]enness, orgies, and things like these. [I]([[Paul]]) [[Warn]] you, as I warned you before, that those who do such things will not [[Inherit]] the [[Kingdom]] of [[God]].
	- Galatians 5:22
	  But the [[Fruit]] of the [Spirit]([[Holy Spirit]]) is [[Love]], [[Joy]], [[Peace]], [[Patience]], [[Kind]]ness, [[Good]]ness, [[Faithful]]ness,
	- Galatians 5:23
	  id:: 673746a9-affc-47a4-ae45-b02a3aa7e2bf
	  [[Gentle]]ness, self-control; [[Against]] such things there is no [[Law]].
	- Galatians 5:24 
	  And those who [[Belong]] to [[Christ]] [[Jesus]] have [crucified]([[Crucify]]) the [[Flesh]] with its [[Passion]]s and [[Desire]]s.
	- Galatians 5:25
	  If we [[Live]] by the [Spirit]([[Holy Spirit]]), let us also [[Keep]] in [[Step]] with the Spirit.
	- Galatians 5:26
	  Let us not become conceited, [provoking]([[Provoke]]) one another, [[Envy]]ing one another.
- Galatians 6
	- Galatians 6:7
	  Do not be [[Deceive]]d: [[God]] is not [[Mock]]ed, for whatever one [[Sow]]s, that will he also [[Reap]].
	- Galatians 6:8
	  For the one who [[Sow]]s to his own [[Flesh]] will from the flesh [[Reap]] [[Corrupt]]ion, but the one who sows to the [Spirit]([[Holy Spirit]]) will from the Spirit reap [[Etern]]al [[Life]].
	- Galatians 6:9
	  id:: 667ea2a6-cddd-4198-8b46-1b8455cb230b
	  And let us not [[Grow]] [[Weary]] of doing [[Good]], for in due [[Season]] we will [[Reap]], if we [do not give up]([[Persevere]]).
	- Galatians 6:10
	  id:: 667ea2b6-7511-4abd-9185-bceb97414175
	  So then, as we have opportunity, let us do [[Good]] to everyone, and especially to those who are of the [household]([[Church]]) of [[Faith]].
