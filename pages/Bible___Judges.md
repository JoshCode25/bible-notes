	  While [[Israel]] [[Live]]d in [[Heshbon]] and its [[Village]]es, and in [[Aroer]] and its villages, and in all the cities that are on the banks of the [[Arnon]], 300 [[Year]]s, why did you not deliver them within that time?
	- Judges 11:27
	  [I]([[Jephthah]]) therefore have not [[Sin]]ned against you, and you do me wrong by making [[War]] on me. The [[LORD]], the [[Judge]], decide this day between the [[People]] of [[Israel]] and the people of [[Ammon]]."
	- Judges 11:28
	  But the [[King]] of the [[Ammon]]ites did not [[Listen]] to the [[Word]]s of [[Jephthah]] that he sent to him.
