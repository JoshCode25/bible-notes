- 06:15 [[Bible Notes]] - [[Josh Gannon]] [[Research]]ed the [[Timeline]] of [[Israel]]'s [[Exodus]] from [[Egypt]]. [[Scholar]]s usually land on 1 of 2 potential dates
	- [[Exodus/Early Date]]: [[BC/1446]]
		- ((668d72d3-acc1-4d34-a044-29bfe897a0f8)) indicates [[Solomon]] began [[Build]]ing the [[Temple]] 480 [[Year]]s after Israel left Egypt. This is widely accepted to occur between [[BC/967]] and [[BC/966]] based on 18 [[Generation]]s listen in ((668d73b9-c55f-41dc-ab42-b28492d48ac1)) - ((668d73cb-b492-4d89-b28c-38b2c0eedee0)) requiring 19 from [[Moses]] to Solomon.
			- 480yrs / 19generations = 25.26yrs/generation is a reasonable number
		- [[Jephthah]]'s message to the [[Ammon]]ite [[King]] in ((668d746b-aab5-41cc-9eb2-c4e380cb47b2)) indicates Israel had been in [[Canaan]] for 300 [[Year]]s. This speech is dated around [[BC/1100]] which leads to an Exodus around 1400 BC
		- [[Archaeological]] information from [[Jericho]], [[AI]], and [[Hazor]] show [[Evidence]] of [Destruction]([[Destroy]]) in the late 15th [[Century]], which is consistent with 1446 Exodus and 1406 [[Conquest]] of [[Canaan]]
			- There's no evidence of an occupation of Jericho in the 13th Century - which is required for [[Exodus/Late Date]]
		- The [[Armana Letters]] show [[Canaanite]] [[King]]s writing [[Letter]]s to [[Pharaoh]] asking for [[Help]] against the “*[[Apiru]]* who were taking over” the land of [[Canaan]] in the late fifteenth [[Century]]

		- The mention of [[Build]]ing [[Raamses]] in ((668d75d1-8061-404c-a049-9476786cef3d)) shouldn't be dated around [1260 BC](((668df1e0-8139-406b-afd4-f32116cbf8b3))) because Israel's multiplication ( ((668d76a2-8c16-456d-918e-3be6fe2a8419)) - ((668d76bd-840e-449c-aaa3-1528232610b0)) ) and [[Moses]]' [[Birth]] in ((668d76c8-a91f-4a98-aca7-f7e5547968ac)) would put the Exodus at [[BC/1190]] if Moses was 80 while leading the people out of Egypt ( ((668d777d-0e80-4c92-89b2-caca15b99c44)) )
			- The [[Mernepteh Stele]] describes a military triumph over Israel in [[Canaan]] between [[BC/1211]] - [[BC/1209]]. This would be before the date of the Exodus
		- The early date allows 350 [[Year]]s for [[Bible/Judges]]. Adding all the years of each [[Judge]] results in a little over 400years. Assuming some overlap between judges, 350years is a reasonable amount of time
	- [[Exodus/Late Date]]: [[BC/1260]]
		- ((668d75d1-8061-404c-a049-9476786cef3d)) mentions Israel [[Build]]ing [[Raamses]] and [[Pithom]]. These [Cities]([[City]]) were built by [[Pharaoh/Raamses II]] who reigned from [[BC/1279]] to [[BC/1213]]. These cities aren't mentioned in any other [[Archaeological]] texts before Raamses II, neither is the [[Red Sea]]
		- ((668d72d3-acc1-4d34-a044-29bfe897a0f8)) could be using 480 [[Year]]s as a representative number for [[Twelve]] *idealized* [[Generation]]s of [[Forty]] years each. Assuming the generations were 25years each results in 300 years. [[BC/966]] - 300 years = approximately 1260 BC
		  id:: 668df1e0-8139-406b-afd4-f32116cbf8b3
		- Egypt had imperial control over [[Canaan]] from [[BC/1400]] to [[BC/1250]], but there’s no [[Record]] of [[Military]] engagement with Israel until the [[Mernepteh Stele]] around [[BC/1211]]
		  id:: 668f2fdf-63af-44ab-82da-b0f98c44b4f5
			- Also [[Bible/Joshua]] or [[Bible/Judges]] don’t mention Egypt even though they had control over Canaan until around [[BC/1200]]
		- The forms of [[Covenant]] used during [[Moses]]’ [[Time]] are much more consistent with [[Ancient Near East]]ern forms in the thirteenth [[Century]] but not the fifteenth
		- [[Archaeological]] discoveries in [[Canaan]] show complete [Destruction]([[Destroy]]) of some [Cities]([[City]]) - like [[Hazor]] - in the later thirteenth [[Century]], a huge [[Migration]] into the [[Hill]] country areas, and [[Technology]] advancements in [[Pottery]], [[Silo]]s, and land [[Terrace]]s that would be consistent with Israel’s occupation

	- [[Conclusion]]: I hold to the [[Exodus/Early Date]] of [[BC/1446]] because it’s more consistent with [[Scripture]] and requires less bending of the text/numbers
		- There may be no [[Record]] of [conflict](((668f2fdf-63af-44ab-82da-b0f98c44b4f5))) with Israel because Egypt’s [[Army]] was lost in the [[Red Sea]] ((668fc091-2fb5-44e0-a2f1-efdc6b22e245)), and they didn’t have the resources to respond to the [Canaanite Kings](((668f3d8f-de55-4819-99bc-749b78e37db3)))
		- The [Destruction and migrations](((668f3a22-8913-4d0c-8e51-60ac60450734))) of [[Canaan]] could have been brought about by [[Invade]]rs during [[Bible/Judges]]
