- 12:30 [[Bible Notes]]
	- It doesn't matter what we [[Build]] for [[God]]; He doesn't [[Need]] or benefit from any of it ((66d1ccf0-09c0-4a57-a802-2731d52901b2)). He's concerned with the [[Posture]] of our [[Hear]]s; are we [[Walk]]ing in [[Humility]] ((66d1ccf0-7965-47e6-a984-4c225f817738))
	- It's possible to [[Work]] and [[Labor]] [[Hard]] for the [[Wrong]] things. [[God]] [[Call]]s us to [[Listen]] to Him. He will [[Direct]] and [[Teach]] us where to put our efforts and what will [satisfy]([[Satisfied]]) ((6697fde4-78b3-487f-9823-6562229316d0)), ((665a0f2d-93a3-4c59-a1d9-a09d3f5c6fa2))\-((665a0f43-b9a7-4c13-b00f-4c3c8d111f37))
