- 06:41 [[Bible Notes]] - what the [[Bible]] says about [[Seven]] [[Day]] [[Creation]] in ((667d6ed7-46f5-4fdb-841a-93816aff397e)) - [[Book/My Search for the Real Heaven]] pgs 42-43,45
	- [[God]] [[Work]]ed [[Six]] days and [[Rest]]ed [[One]] For the [[Sabbath]] - ((66ad607a-9bfa-489a-9d50-fe0a426a23a6)), ((67051c2c-a45c-4c1f-9438-220402e9584c))
	- [[Jesus]] associates [[Abel]]’s [[Murder]] \(((67051f1b-6a32-4e08-858d-8505d1e32eb7))) with the [[Foundation]] of the [[World]] - ((67051e2f-33c9-4fd4-96a8-af5601228dec)), ((67051e0d-75e7-422c-990d-cd44667e92d3))
	- [[Jesus]] says [[God]] [[Create]]d [[Male]] and [[Female]] from the [[Beginning]] of [[Creation]] - ((67051ff2-2fdc-429a-be00-fd8b38ee58df))
	- [[Paul]] says [[Death]] came through [[Adam]] in ((6707bda4-2ccd-4e84-a9f5-0d012958d9aa)) and ((66b4b0db-7410-4751-89cd-d8f20fc019dd)) - ((66b4b0db-9c80-4e86-81c4-f3e3edc186b9)). In order for [[Evolution]] to have over millions of [[Year]]s, each new species would need to [[Die]] as it developed into the next one
		- *Death* is [[Greek/thanatos]] [Here](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g2288/esv/mgnt/0-1/)
		- *[[Dead]]* is [[Greek/nekros]] [Here](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g3498/esv/mgnt/0-1/)
		- ((66b4b0db-7410-4751-89cd-d8f20fc019dd)) says [[Sin]] and death [came]([[Come]]) into the *[[World]]* ([[Greek/kosmos]] which describes mankind apart from God/the [[Heaven]]s)
			- This could be [[Interpret]]ted that death only came to [[Human]]s, but God told Adam He cursed the [[Ground]] in ((670a664c-741c-4aa7-b15f-da940b4a02b4)), and ((66b4b0db-c947-4991-bbda-4bf3c6fe5402)) - ((66b4b0db-2898-4954-a209-86aec8a84c8f)) describes creation [[Groan]]ing under its [[Curse]] until it’s time to be [[Free]]d
	- [[God]] uses [[Hebrew/muwth]] in ((67091461-c0b2-4c0b-a79c-c0cffd5d8b5e)) when He tells [[Adam]] he would *[[Die]]* if he [ate]([[Eat]]) of the [[Tree]] of the [[Knowledge]] of [[Good]] and [[Evil]]. This word is used 835 in the [[Old Testament]] and largely refers to [[Death]] of the [[Body]]
		- This is the same word used in ((67093894-aa93-4943-8121-659feb4b6de5)) to document Adam’s death at 930 - which is these than the millions of years it would have required for him to life past the [[Seven]]th day-age when God [[Rest]]ed
	- [[Hebrew/yowm]] is introduced in ((667d6ed7-46f5-4fdb-841a-93816aff397e)) for the [[Word]] Day. It’s the same one used in ((66ad607a-9bfa-489a-9d50-fe0a426a23a6)) and ((67051c2c-a45c-4c1f-9438-220402e9584c))
